Will do.

I went very by the spec here, with those advance users in mind. I do
think the user with limited knowledge may get frustrated by the rules.
ie. like finding that their total capacity is not all partitionable
capacity. I looked at ipmctl goal setting, where they do percentages,
and didn't pursue - stuck with the spec.

I like this below. If user wants 100% of any type, no math needed. But,
anything else the user will have to specify a byte value.

I don't get the language "and -s is '0' for 100%", specifically, the
"-s is 0".

If -s is ommitted the default behavior will be to set 100% of the
partitionable capacity to type.

If both type and size are ommitted, 100% of partitionable capacity is
set to PMEM.

Humor me...are these right?  

set-partition mem0
	100% to pmem

set-partition mem0 -tpmem 
	100% to pmem

set-partition mem0 -tvolatile -s0
	100% to pmem          ^^ That's what I think a -s0 does?!?

set-partition mem0 -tvolatile
	100% to volatile

set-partition mem0 -tvolatile -s256MB
	256MB to volatile
	Remainder to pmem

set-partition mem0 -s256MB
	256MB to pmem
	Remainder to volatile

Thanks!

Got it.

My read of the spec says partition alignment is "Expressed in multiples
of 256MB", not static. Where is it defined as static?

Got it.

Thanks Dan.
