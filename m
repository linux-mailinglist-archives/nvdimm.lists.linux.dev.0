That's not my repo, it's the official one ;-)
but yeh, my passthrough example got merged last week:

Yeh, sorry, that was a bit confusing.
The statement is that because the simples plan as Miklos
suggested is to pass the extent list in reply to open
two different opens of the same inode are not allowed to
pass in different extent lists.

The new iomode.c code does something similar.
Currently fuse_inode has a reference to fuse_backing which
stores the backing file (that can be the dax device) and it also
has a reference to fuse_inode_dax with an rbtree of fuse_dax_mapping
Can we reuse fuse_inode_dax for the needs of famfs?

The first open would cache the extent list in fuse_inode and
second open would verify that the extent list matches.

Last file close could clean the cache extent list or not - that
is an API decision.

Thanks,
Amir.
