For those reading along at home, ARCH_HAS_CPU_CACHE_INVALIDATE_MEMREGION is wbinvd.

We don't have an instruction for arm64 that 'invalidates all caches'.

The best we can do today is to use the by-VA invalidate operations in the kernel.
This isn't guaranteed to invalidate 'invisible' system caches, which means its not enough
for a one-size-fits-all kernel interface.
For the NVDIMM secure-erase users of this thing, if there were a system-cache between the
CPUs and the NVDIMM, there is nothing the kernel can do to invalidate it.

If its CXL specific this would be okay for testing in Qemu, but performance would scale
with the size of the region, which would hurt in real world cases.

The plan is to add a firmware call so firmware can do things that don't scale with the
size of the mapping, and do something platform-specific to the 'invisible' system cache,
if there is one.


Ideally we wait for the PSCI spec update that describes the firmware call, and make
support dependent on that. It looks like the timeline will be March-ish, but there should
be an alpha of the spec available much sooner.

It works for CXL because you'd never have a system-cache in front of the CXL window.
Those things don't necessarily receive cache-maintenance because they are supposed to be
invisible.

D7.4.11 of DDI0487I.a "System level caches" has this horror:
| System caches which lie beyond the point of coherency and so are invisible to the
| software. The management of such caches is outside the scope of the architecture.

(The PoP stuff reaches beyond the PoC, but there isn't a DC CIVAP instruction)

Detecting which regions we can't do this for is problematic.
