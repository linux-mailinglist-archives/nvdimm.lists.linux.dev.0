I do have a use case for this work absent the reflink work. Recall we
had a conversation about how to communicate "dax-device has been
ripped away from the fs" events and we ended up on the idea of reusing
->notify_failure(), but with the device's entire logical address range
as the notification span. That will let me unwind and delete the
PTE_DEVMAP infrastructure for taking extra device references to hold
off device-removal. Instead ->notify_failure() arranges for all active
DAX mappings to be invalidated and allow the removal to proceed
especially since physical removal does not care about software pins.
