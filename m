If I understand the proposal correctly Boris is basically saying
"figure out how to do your special PMEM stuff in the driver directly
and make it so MCE code has no knowledge of the PMEM case". The flow
is:

memory_failure(pfn, flags)
nfit_handle_mce(...) <--- right now this on mce notifier chain
set_mce_nospec(pfn) <--- drop the "whole page" concept

This poses a problem because not all memory_failure() paths trigger
set_mce_nospec() or the mce notifier chain. If that disconnect
happens, attempts to read PMEM pages that have been signalled to
memory_failure() will now crash in the driver without workarounds for
NP pages.

So memory_failure() needs to ensure that it communicates with the
driver before any possible NP page attribute changes. I.e. the driver
needs to know that regardless of how many cachelines are poisoned the
entire page is always unmapped in the direct map.

Then, when the driver is called with the new RWF_RECOVER_DATA flag, it
can set up a new UC alias mapping for the pfn and access the good data
in the page while being careful to read around the poisoned cache
lines.

In my mind this moves the RWF_RECOVER_DATA flag proposal from "nice to
have" to "critical for properly coordinating with memory_failure() and
mce expectations"
