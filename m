So cxl_test takes the opposite approach and tries not to pollute the
production code with test instrumentation. All of the infrastructure
to replace calls and inject mocked values is self contained in
tools/testing/cxl/ where it builds replacement modules with test
instrumentation. Otherwise its a maintenance burden, in my view, to
read the error injection macros in the nominal code paths.

Certainly those would be good to use behind the mocked interfaces.
