On second look, the error message does not make sense because there is
"no functionality" not "limited functionality" as a result of this
failure because the cxl_pci driver just gives up. This failure should
be limited to cxl_mem, not cxl_pci as there might still be value in
accessing the mailbox on this device.

If there is no CXL DVSEC then cxl_mem should fail, that's it.

What would the bug report be, "driver fails to attach to device that
does not implement the spec"?
