Yes, although I believe that DRAM patrol scrubbing is being done from
the host memory controller, these PMEM DIMMs have firmware and DMA
engines *in the DIMM* to do this scrub work.

Perhaps, but I don't know how you do that if memory_failure() has
"offlined" the DRAM page, in the case of PMEM you can issue a
byte-aligned direct-I/O access to the exact storage locations around
the poisoned cachelines.

PMEM can still go NP if the entire page is failed, so no need to
exclude PMEM from the treatise because the driver's badblocks
implementation will cover the NP page, and the driver can use
clear_mce_nospec() to recover the WB mapping / access after the poison
has been cleared.
