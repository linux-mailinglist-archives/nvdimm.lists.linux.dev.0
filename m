The reason for these two sub-helpers was to force me to structure the
code so that Matthews original idea of replacing ->iomap_begin and
->iomap_end with a single next callback so that iomap_iter could
be inlined into callers and the indirect calls could be elided is
still possible.  This would only be useful for a few specific
methods (probably dax and direct I/O) where we care so much, but it
seemed like a nice idea conceptually so I would not want to break it.

OTOH we could just remove this function for now and do that once needed.

iter.c is also my preference, but in the end I don't care too much.
