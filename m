I don't really care. To my mind the hardware is broken anyway,
but if you want to try and enable 'some stuff' then I'm fine with
that - mostly I think if it's broken enough that the DVSEC locator
isn't there, then chances the mailbox works are probably low, but
then I'm not implementing the hardware :)
