Thanks Dan for the thorough review, appreciated and...  unfortunately
rare, especially for shell scripts!

As I explained in the cover letter, the problem is: testing. While
logically independent, it's in practice impossible to thoroughly test
these changes independently of each other. That's OK; I'll keep
performing thorough testing in my workspace and I will also make sure no
single, smaller commit introduces any regression in this particular
check_dmesg() area. The current bar is pretty low in this specific
check_dmsg() area so this shouldn't be a problem.

So, in v4 I will submit only the switch from SECONDS to NDTEST_START.
It's 1. logically coming first 2. low risk, low stakes and low
contention. 3. almost half the code: it will be nice to get all that out
of the way.

For that reason, I will for now answer only your comments below that are
related to this first NDTEST_START commit and (preciously) keep your
other comments for a later reply.

Yes - and more generally speaking that no test log will be missing, and
also making sure the test anchors are accurate.

There is none now but it's really not that hard to imagine someone
wanting to do random stuff before sourcing test/common. This was not an
issue with $SECONDS and without log anchors; it is one now.

Also, this is just one very simple line; costs practically nothing.

Because test duration is more user-friendly that manually substracting
timestamps; all sorts of people read logs when tests fail and they may
not automatically know that "sourcing common" implies SECONDS is 0 or 1;
it is consistent with other log statements using SECONDS too; it takes
almost no space in the logs; in case the check above gets dropped, this
can become even more useful.

Generally speaking, there is rarely ever "too much" information in
failure logs, only too much "volume" - and SECONDS takes practically
zero space.

Good idea!

Good idea (after NDTEST_START).

Because this is approximative (+1000) to give a bit more background and
it's easier to do math on SECONDS in shell scripts than on timestamps.

It's a "sleep" so it is magical. That does not automatically make it
bad.

The purpose is a bit different now, funny that git diff matched it.

There is no such hard guarantee but testing can only prove the existence
of bugs, not their absence. It's not an exact science. This sleep 1 does
not help with effects delayed more than 1s, but it does help with all
delayed effects shorter 1s and that is useful. So, why 1s specifically?
Because 1s is a short time for humans and for most tests in this suite
while being a very long time for computers - plenty enough time for many
timers to expire and for journalctl to get all kernel messages. I can
make it 0.5s, that should work too and save time when running the whole
suite.

Sorry, I don't see what specific part could go stale in this
one... Could you elaborate?
