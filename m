Right. It was the fastest way to see if something would work. It isn't meant to be the design goal in the future.

The use case mainly is to see if the people currently using DAX via mmap() would utilize this for other usages as a bridge vs something like the private node implementation Gregory is working on that has a totally different way of doing things. So yes what you suggested could be another way to do it. Mainly I want to see if there's even any interest at all. And if so then we can talk about how we want it to be done and I'm wide open on that.

I think if we are to implement this then I think so at some point.
