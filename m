Ouch, yes, that is actually (still) on my list. Also, adding struct
pages for dcssblk in XIP / DAX mode is not really prohibitive. The
whole feature was designed to allow saving memory when the same
binaries need to be executed from many z/VM guests. The XIP
(execute-in-place) part allows to execute them directly from the
DCSS (shared) memory segment, saving page cache usage on all guests.

Additionally saving the struct pages for the DCSS memory itself can
be considered a bonus, but it's just 1/64th of the otherwise saved
memory. For this reason, and also because there are hardly any users
of that feature left, we certainly can do w/o that, i.e. live with
having the struct pages.

I must admit that I neglected this a bit, and it was only a question
of time until this popped up again (rightfully). I understand that
having and maintaining this FS_DAX_LIMITED workaround is really ugly.

So I will give this some priority now, and I hope that it still only
affects dcssblk, and we did not get any other non-s390 users in the
meantime.

BTW, s390 xpram driver should not be affected. AFAIR, we also might
not have struct pages there, but it also is not possible to use it
with DAX, so it should not care about FS_DAX_LIMITED.
