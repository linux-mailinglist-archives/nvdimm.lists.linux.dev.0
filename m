Input validation. Every value that gets written to a sysfs attribute
should be checked for validity, more below:

Yes, but it saves userspace a step to get the absolute value here and
matches what happens in PCI sysfs where the user is not required to
look up the bridge base to calculate the absolute value.

Userspace asks by DPA size and SPA size and the kernel validates /

sysfs is always stateful. Stateless would be an ioctl.

No, that's a bit too much magic, and it would be racy.

So, I don't want to merge an interim solution. I think this series
needs to prove out the end to end final ABI with all the lifetime
issues worked out before committing to it upstream because lifetime
issues get much harder to fix when they also need to conform to a
legacy ABI.

The kernel always needs to protect itself. Userspace is free to race
itself, but it can not be allowed to trigger a kernel race. So there
needs to be protection against userspace writing interleave_ways and
the kernel being able to trust that interleave_ways is now static for
the life of the region.

That safety was about preventing userspace from leaking kernel memory,
not about protecting userspace from itself. It's still the case that
userspace racing itself will get horribly confused when it collides
region creation, but the kernel protects itself by resolving the race.

Don't let userspace break the kernel, that's it.

More flexibility =3D=3D more maintenance burden. If it's not strictly
necessary, don't expose it, so making this read-only seems simpler to
me.

Yeah, CONFIG_PROVE_{NVDIMM,CXL}_LOCKING needs to annotate the
driver-core as well. I'm concerned there's a class of deadlocks that
lockdep just can't see.

Given the conflicts that can arise between HDM decoders needing to map
increasing DPA values and other conflicts that there will be
situations where the kernel auto-picking a decoder will get in the
way. Exposing the decoder selection to userspace also gives one more
place to do leaf validation. I.e. at decoder-to-region assignment time
the kernel can validate that the DPA is available and can be mapped by
the given decoder given the state of other decoders on that device.

Right, put the user friendliness in the tooling, not sysfs ABI.

->remove() does not seem a good fit since it may be the case that
someone wants do "echo $region >
/sys/bus/cxl/drivers/cxl_region/unbind; echo $region >
/sys/bus/cxl/drivers/cxl_region/bind;" without needing to go
reconfigure the targets. I am suggesting that before
device_unregister(&cxlr->dev) the targets are released.
