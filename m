What is the purpose of having the new tool when it cannot handle the
full configuration, and users still need to refer to the old tool for
some cases?

Then to make life or users simpler I vould completely skip the new
partial tool.

Other than that if the new tools provide some value but are
platform-specific it is slight annoyance to package different set of
tools depending on target architecture but it's not something that
cannot be managed.

Thanks
