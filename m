That depends on how much gluecode you can stand up to redirect older
programs.

I doubt it.  md-raid presents a unified LBA address space, which means
that the filesystem doesn't have to know anything about whatever
translations might happen underneath it.  Even memory controllers
quietly take care of striping across DIMMs and whatnot.

Most filesystems that implement striping themselves don't restrict
themselves to monotonically increasing LBA ranges rotored across each
device like md-raid0 does.

But for whatever reason, pmem/dax don't have remapping layers like
md/dm so filesystems have to do that on their own if the hardware
doesn't do it for them.

"Generic"... do we even /have/ a second user?  I don't feel like we do.
