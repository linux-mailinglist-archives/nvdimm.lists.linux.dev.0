I think that puts us back in the situation that Tony fixed in:

17fae1294ad9 x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is
affected and poisoned

...where the clflush in _set_memory_uc() causes more unwanted virtual
#MC injection.

I think that means that we have no choice but to mark the page NP
unconditionally and do the work to ensure that the driver has updated
its poisoned cacheline tracking for data recovery requests.

Right?
