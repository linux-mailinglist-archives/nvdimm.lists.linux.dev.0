It would definitely be interesting to understand why pushing decision making
into the leaf code is a violation. Was it primary around the descriptiveness of
the error?

These are obviously easy and informative at attr store time (in fact, active was
meant to be checked already for many cases). So if we agree to codify this at
probe via WARN, and add it to kdoc, I've no problem with it.

I intentionally avoided doing a lot of these until probe because it seemed like
not a great policy to deny regions from being populated if another region
utilizing those resources hasn't been bound yes. For a simple example, if x1
region A is created and utilizes all of memdev ɑ's capacity you block out any
other region setup using memdev ɑ, even if region A wasn't bound. There's a
similar problem with specifying decoders as part of configuration.

I'll infer from your comment that you are fine with this tradeoff, or you have
some other way to manage this in mind.

I really see any validation which requires removal of resources from the system
to be more fit for bind time. I suppose if the proposal is to move the region
attributes to be DEVICE_ATTR_ADMIN, that pushes the problem onto the system
administrator. It just seemed like most of the interface could be non-root.

Somewhat addressed above too...

I think that depends on whether the full list is established as mentioned. If in
the region driver we can put several assertions that a variety of things don't
need [re]validation, then it doesn't matter. Without this, when trying to debug
or add code you need to figure out which place is doing the validation and which
place should do it.

At the very least I think the plan should be established in a kdoc.
