I think the history here is that generic/482 was changed over first in
commit 65cc9a235919 ("generic/482: use thin volume as data device"), and
then sometime later we realized generic/455,457,470 had the same general
flaw and were switched over. The dm/dax compatibility thing was probably
just an oversight, but I am a little curious about that because it should
have been obvious that the change caused the test to no longer run. Did
something change after that to trigger that change in behavior?

I don't quite recall the characteristics of the failures beyond that we
were seeing spurious test failures with generic/482 that were due to
essentially putting the fs/log back in time in a way that wasn't quite
accurate due to the clearing by the logwrites tool not taking place. If
you wanted to reproduce in order to revisit that, perhaps start with
generic/482 and let it run in a loop for a while and see if it
eventually triggers a failure/corruption..?

It's been a while since I looked at any of this tooling to semi-grok how
it works. Perhaps it could learn to rely on something more explicit like
zero range (instead of discard?) or fall back to manual zeroing? If the
eventual solution is simple and low enough overhead, it might make some
sense to replace the dmthin hack across the set of tests mentioned
above.
