Thanks for your attention Kent.

I'm on it. Part of the core idea behind famfs is that page-oriented data
movement can be avoided with actual shared memory. Yes, the memory is likely to 
be slower (either BW or latency or both) but it's cacheline access rather than 
full-page (or larger) retrieval, which is a win for some access patterns (and
not so for others).

Part of the issue is communicating the fact that shared access to cachelines
is possible.

There are some interesting possibilities with GPUs retrieving famfs files
(or portions thereof), but I have no insight as to the motivations of GPU 
vendors.

Famfs is intended to be mounted from more than one host from the same in-memory
image. A metadata log is kinda the simpliest approach to make that work (let me
know your thoughts if you disagree on that). When a client mounts, playing the 
log from the shared memory brings that client mount into sync with the source 
(the Master).

No inter-node locking is currently needed because only the node that created
the file system (the Master) can write the log. Famfs is not intended to be 
a general-purpose FS...

The famfs log is currently append-only, and I think of it as a "code-first"
implementation of a shared memory FS that that gets the job done in something
approaching the simplest possible approach.

If the approach evolves to full allocate-on-write, then moving to a file system
platform that handles that would make sense. If it remains (as I suspect will
make sense) a way to share collections of data sets, or indexes, or other 
data that is published and then consumed [all or mostly] read-only, this
simple approach may be long-term sufficient.

Regards,
John
