This has just a single users, so the classic argument won't apply.  That
being said __xfs_filemap_fault is a complete mess to due the calling
conventions of the various VFS methods multiplexed into it.  So yes,
splitting out a xfs_dax_iomap_fault to wrap the above plus the
dax_finish_sync_fault call might not actually be a bad idea nevertheless.

I'd argue against just changing the calling conventions for ->iomap_end
now.  The original iter patches from willy allowed passing a single
next callback combinging iomap_begin and iomap_end in a way that with
a little magic we can avoid the indirect calls entirely.  I think we'll
need to experiment with that that a bit and see if is worth the effort
first.  I plan to do that but I might not get to it immediate.  If some
else wants to take over I'm fine with that.

More importantly before we can merge this series we also need the VM
level support for reflink-aware reverse mapping.  So while this series
here is no in a good enough shape I don't see how we could merge it
without that other series as we'd have to disallow mmap for reflink+dax
files otherwise.
