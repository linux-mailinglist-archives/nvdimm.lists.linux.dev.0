I was wondering about that after I wrote this...  I guess it guarantees
we won't get a late landing write or is that not even true?

So if we remove memory, then added fresh memory again quickly enough
can we get a left over write showing up?  I guess that doesn't matter as
the kernel will chase it with a memset(0) anyway and that will be ordered
as to the same address.

However we won't be able to elide that zeroing even if we know the device
did it which is makes some operations the device might support rather
pointless :(

It's a draft spec and Mark + James in +CC can hopefully confirm.
It does say
"Cleans and invalidates all caches, including system caches".
which I'd read as meaning it should but good to confirm.

I would love that to be the way things go, but I fear the overheads of
doing that on the protocol means people will want the option of the painful
approach.
