Ok, now I see where you are going, but I don't see line of sight to
something better than RWF_RECOVER_DATA.

This goes back to one of the original DAX concerns of wanting a kernel
library for coordinating PMEM mmap I/O vs leaving userspace to wrap
PMEM semantics on top of a DAX mapping. The problem is that mmap-I/O
has this error-handling-API issue whether it is a DAX mapping or not.
I.e. a memory failure in page cache is going to signal the process the
same way and it will need to fall back to something other than mmap
I/O to make forward progress. This is not a PMEM, Intel or even x86
problem, it's a generic CONFIG_ARCH_SUPPORTS_MEMORY_FAILURE problem.

CONFIG_ARCH_SUPPORTS_MEMORY_FAILURE implies that processes will
receive SIGBUS + BUS_MCEERR_A{R,O} when memory failure is signalled
and then rely on readv(2)/writev(2) to recover. Do you see a readily
available way to improve upon that model without CPU instruction
changes? Even with CPU instructions changes, do you think it could
improve much upon the model of interrupting the process when a load
instruction aborts?

I do agree with you that DAX needs to separate itself from block, but
I don't think it follows that DAX also needs to separate itself from
readv/writev for when a kernel slow-path needs to get involved because
mmap I/O (just CPU instructions) does not have the proper semantics.
Even if you got one of the ARCH_SUPPORTS_MEMORY_FAILURE to implement
those semantics in new / augmented CPU instructions you will likely
not get all of them to move and certainly not in any near term
timeframe, so the kernel path will be around indefinitely.

Meanwhile, I think RWF_RECOVER_DATA is generically useful for other
storage besides PMEM and helps storage-drivers do better than large
blast radius "I/O error" completions with no other recourse.
