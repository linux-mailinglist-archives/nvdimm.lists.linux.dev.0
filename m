But he hasn't answered my question regarding what data duplication he
meant, exactly.

So what data duplication do you mean?

Well, maybe.

But then please minimize the number of code lines changed in this
particular patch and please avoid changes that are not directly
related to the purpose of the patch.

I have a differing opinion on a couple of points above, and let's make
one change at a time.

No, ACPI device is not obsolete, it will still be needed for various
things, like power management and hotplug.

Also, I'd rather store a struct acpi_device than acpi_handle, because
the latter is much better from the compile-time type correctness
checks and similar.

I can send my version of the $subject patch just fine if you strongly
disagree with me.
