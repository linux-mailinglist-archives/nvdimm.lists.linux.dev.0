Thank you for your answer. But I still feel something is strange.
Though dm-thinp may be good way to execute the test correctly,
I suppose it seems to be likely a kind of workaround to pass the test,
it may not be really required for actual users.

Could you tell me why passing test by workaround is so necessary?

Thanks,
