Want to indicate it 'might' write back perhaps?
So could be invalidate or clean and invalidate (using arm ARM terms just to add
to the confusion ;)

Feels like there will be potential race conditions where that matters as we might
force stale data to be written back.

Perhaps a comment is enough for that. Anyone have the "famous last words" feeling?
