I internalized this kernel design principle from Dave Miller many
years ago paraphrasing "push decision making out to leaf code as much
as possible", and centralizing all validation in cxl_region_probe()
violates. The software that makes the mistake does not know it made a
mistake until much later and "probe failed" is less descriptive than
"EINVAL writing interleave_ways" . I wish I could find the thread
because it also talked about his iteration process.

Basic input validation to me is things like:

- Don't allow writes while the region is active
- Check that values are in bound. So yes, the interleave-ways value of
3 would fail until the kernel supports it, and granularity values >
16K would also fail.
- Check that memdevs are actually downstream targets of the given decoder
- Check that the region uuid is unique
- Check that decoder has capacity
- Check that the memdev has capacity
- Check that the decoder to map the DPA is actually available given
decoders must be programmed in increasing DPA order

Essentially any validation short of walking the topology to program
upstream decoders since those errors are only resolved by racing
region probes that try to grab upstream decoder resources.

The validation helpers need to be written once, where they are called

Yes, similar use case as /proc/iomem. Error handling comes to mind as
you can see physical address data in the messages like machine check
notification and go immediately match that to a CXL region. PCI,
NVDIMM, and DAX all emit a "resource" attribute to identify the
physical address base.

Forcing a write order simplifies the validation matrix. Consider the
reduction in test surface if the kernel is more strict about what it
allows into the kernel early. Let's make syzbot's job harder.

Yeah, why carry unnecessary code in the kernel? Userspace is well
equipped to meet the requirement that it writes the UUID.

Yes.

It's not clear that a region needs to hold a reference if a memdev
self removes itself from the region before it is unregistered. I am
open to being convinced this is needed but it would need come with an
explanation of what can a region do with a memdev reference after that
memdev has experienced a ->remove() event.

It turns out there's no such thing as "managed remove" as far as the
kernel is concerned, it's all up to userspace. ->remove() can happen
at any time and ->remove() can not fail. Per Bjorn Linux does not
support PCIe hotplug latching so there is no kernel mechanism to block
hotplug. Unless and until the PCIe native hotplug code picks up a
mechanism to deny unplug events CXL needs to be prepared for any
memdev to experience ->remove() regardless of region status.

For example, I expect the "managed remove" flow is something like this:

# cxl disable-memdev mem3
cxl memdev: action_disable: mem3 is part of an active region
cxl memdev: cmd_disable_memdev: disabled 0 mem

...where the tool tries to enforce safety, but if someone really wants
that device gone:

# cxl disable-memdev mem3 --force
cxl memdev: cmd_disable_memdev: disabled 1 mem

...and the CXL sub-system will need to trigger memory-failure across
all the regions that were impacted by that violent event.

It's not needed since the agent that wrote interleave ways is also
expected to be the agent that is configuring the rest of the
parameters.

I think we get this for free by just linking the region to each
endpoint decoder in use and then userspace can walk that to get DPA
info from the decoder (modulo extending endpoint decoders with DPA
extent info).

Let me know if the arguments I have made for why more granularity is
necessary have changed your preference. I'm open to hearing alternate
ideas.
