FWIW, I've got quite a bit of cleanups in the local tree; reordering and
cleaning that queue up at the moment, will post tonight or tomorrow.

I've looked into doing allocations page-by-page (instead of single
push_pipe(), followed by copying into those).  Doable, but it ends
up being much messier.

IMO this "truncate on failure" approach is saner.
