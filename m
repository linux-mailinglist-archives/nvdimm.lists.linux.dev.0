It's confusing me.  :)  I know the confusion source exists but
that doesn't mean I remember how all the terms match up.

Given the read only shared concept relies on multiple hardware dc regions
(I think they map to partitions) then we are very likely to see
multiples.  (maybe I'm lost in terminology as well).

versus one time rename of all internal infrastructure to align to the spec
and only keep the confusion at the boundaries where we have ABI.

Horrible option but how often are those diving in the code that bothered
about the userspace /kernel interaction terminology?

Anyhow, they are all horrible choices.
