Good question.  I thought it should work when the caller doesn't set any
bit in PFN_FLAGS_MASK, but it turns out it's not the case?  As I just
notice:

static inline bool pfn_t_has_page(pfn_t pfn)
{
	return (pfn.val & PFN_MAP) == PFN_MAP || (pfn.val & PFN_DEV) == 0;
}

So it looks like "no PFN_FLAGS" case should also fall into this category of
"(pfn.val & PFN_DEV) == 0"..

I'm not sure whether my understanding is correct, though.  Maybe we'd want
to double check with pfn_valid() when it's a generic function.

It'll be fine if it needs page*, then it'll be NULL for VFIO.

So far it looks cleaner if it has the pgtable entry anyway to me, as that
indeed contains the pfn.  But I'd trust you more on what should it look
like, as I didn't read the whole series here.

https://github.com/xzpeter/linux/commits/vfio-pfnmap-all/

Specifically Alex's commit here:

https://github.com/xzpeter/linux/commit/afd05f1082bc78738e280f1fc1937da52b2572ed

Just a note that it's still work in progress.  Alex did run it through (not
this tree, but an older one) and it works pretty well so far.

I think it's because so far nothing involves the pfn flags, the only one
has it involved is (taking pmd as example):

insert_pfn_pmd():
	if (!pmd_none(*pmd)) {
		if (write) {
			if (pmd_pfn(*pmd) != pfn_t_to_pfn(pfn)) {
				WARN_ON_ONCE(!is_huge_zero_pmd(*pmd));
				goto out_unlock;
			}
			entry = pmd_mkyoung(*pmd);
			entry = maybe_pmd_mkwrite(pmd_mkdirty(entry), vma);
			if (pmdp_set_access_flags(vma, addr, pmd, entry, 1))
				update_mmu_cache_pmd(vma, addr, pmd);
		}

		goto out_unlock;
	}

But for VFIO it'll definitely be pmd_none() here, so the whole path ignores
pfn flags so far here, I assume.

Great!  I hope it'll reduce the diff for this series too, so it could be a
win-win.
