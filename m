device-dax uses PUD, along with TTM, they are the only places. I'm not
sure TTM is a real place though.

As I understand things, something like FSDAX post-folio should
generate maximal compound pages for extents in the page cache that are
physically contiguous.

A high order folio can be placed in any lower order in the page
tables, so we never have to fracture it, unless the underlying page
are moved around - which requires an unmap_mapping_range() cycle..

Hmm, I don't know.. I sketched out the refcount stuff and the code is
OK but ugly and will add a conditional to some THP cases

On the other hand, making THP unmap cases a bit slower is probably a
net win compared to making put_page a bit slower.. Considering unmap
is already quite heavy.

Here I imagine the thing that creates the pgmap would specify the
policy it wants. In most cases the policy is tightly coupled to what
the free function in the the provided dev_pagemap_ops does..

Which is a reasonable refinment if we think there are cases where two
nvdim users would want different things.

Anyhow, I'm wondering on a way forward. There are many balls in the
air, all linked:
 - Joao's compound page support for device_dax and more
 - Alex's DEVICE_COHERENT
 - The refcount normalization
 - Removing the pgmap test from GUP
 - Removing the need for the PUD/PMD/PTE special bit
 - Removing the need for the PUD/PMD/PTE devmap bit
 - Remove PUD/PMD vma_is_special
 - folios for fsdax
 - shootdown for fsdax

Frankly I'm leery to see more ZONE_DEVICE users crop up that depend on
the current semantics as that will only make it even harder to fix..

I think it would be good to see Joao's compound page support move
ahead..

So.. Does anyone want to work on finishing this patch series?? I can
give some guidance on how I think it should work at least
