Ah - that might be the answer. I will check if dropped capabilities 
disappear in fuse_send_init. If so, I can work with that - not advertising 
the famfs capability unless the capability is present at that point looks 
like a perfectly good option. Thanks for that idea!

SW RAID, and mapper in general, has a "store and forward" property (or maybe
"store, transmogrify, and forward") that doesn't really work for memory. 
It's vma's (and files) that can remap memory address regions. Layered vma's 
anyone? I need to think about whether that's utter nonsense, or just mostly 
nonsense.

Continuing to think about this...

Thanks!
