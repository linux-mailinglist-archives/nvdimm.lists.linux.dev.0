I wasn't planning on QEMU support, but if someone wants to do it I'll be
happy to review!  Patches welcome etc.  As Dan says, it'll be a job for BIOS
configuration and so far we don't have a suitable BIOS to run against
the QEMU emulation - there is code for ARM's own models (FVP) as talked about
at Plumbers CXL UConf, but I don't know of anyone looking at getting that
up and running on top of QEMU yet.  That would be best done first on CXL 2.0+
but once it is place, a full setup for RCH would be possible.

Given there is hardware and new features aren't going to be built on RCH
topologies, I'd guess no one will care enough to write QEMU emulation
any time soon.
