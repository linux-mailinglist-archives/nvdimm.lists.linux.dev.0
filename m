Hi Mpe,

Thanks for looking into this patch.

The ndtest module (tools/testing/nvdimm/test/ndtest.c) is implemented in
an arch independed way to enable testing of PAPR PDSMs on non ppc64
platforms like x86_64. It uses the same PDSM structs as used by papr_scm
to communicate with libndctl userspace. 

Since papr_scm is ppc64 arch specific we were so far duplicating the
PDSM structures between ndtest and papr_scm. The patch tries to solve
this duplication by moving the shared structs to arch independent common
include dirs.

Secondly, PDSMs describes how userspace can use NVDIMM_FAMILY_PAPR to
interact with NVDIMMs. So potentially a new NVDIMM beyond powerpc arch
can add its support and would need access to the same structs used by
papr_scm and ndtest. In that context it would make sense to move PDSM
headers to generic include dirs.

No, as ndtest implements support for NVDIMM_FAMILY_PAPR and would need
access to PDSM related structs which presently are only available for
powerpc.
