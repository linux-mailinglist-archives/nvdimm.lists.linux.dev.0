I=E2=80=99m not sure the capability bit can be used like that (though I am
hoping it can!). As I understand it, once the kernel advertises a
capability, it must continue supporting it in future kernels else
userspace programs that rely on it will break.

John, with what you have in this series, is there any way we can make
it generalizable so it can be used by any dax-based server? Would you
be open to that?

My main gripe is with the layout encoding for FUSE_GET_FMAP and how it
bakes in famfs-specific layout concepts (simple vs interleaved
extents, file type, strip definitions, etc) into the uapi and forces
the kernel to interpret/process this super-specific encoding in a
hardcoded way. Is it not possible to just move this all to the server
side? Could the famfs server just preprocess the mappings and take
care of the simple vs interleaved extents stuff and do all the logic
that's in [1] in userspace and simply just give the kernel a list of
generic extent mapping information? The kernel could then just cache
this generic mapping per inode and do the lookup on fault with no
famfs-specific logic needed in the kernel. Or is there a reason the
famfs processing logic needs to happen in the kernel? That's the part
I'm unclear about.

I think this is pretty much what Darrick is doing in his iomap
patchset [2] except in his case, the mappings are fetched lazily on
access, whereas I guess for your case that would be too slow so it
needs to be prepopulated at open time. imo that seems fine since
prepopulating mappings would be a useful feature in general. So could
we rename FUSE_GET_FMAP to something like FUSE_IOMAP_GETMAP and have
it just return super generic mapping info? Darrick already adds a
"struct fuse_iomap_io" [3] to the uapi, could we just use that and add
a uint32_t dev_id; to that?

Looking more at Darrick's patchset, his caching [4] uses the b+ tree
and is more performant but imo also more complex, but I don't think
that would be necessary for this series. imo we could just use a basic
interval tree for now for famfs's needs and optimize / converge it
later.

As well, are you open to renaming the FUSE_DAX_FMAP capability and
FUSE_FAMFS_DAX config to a generic FUSE_IOMAP_DAX naming scheme
instead?

Additionally, it would be really nice to replace FUSE_GET_DAXDEV and
add the daxdev config stuff to the generic FUSE_IOMAP_CONFIG Darrick
has for iomap [5], but this one might be more contentious in getting
the config uapi solidified. I think in general though for famfs, it
makes more sense for all the dax devices to be set up upfront all at
once at connection init time instead of discovered lazily on every
file open, which as I understand it,  would make things less complex
server side for famfs too, so even if this doesn't go through
FUSE_IOMAP_CONFIG, maybe it makes sense to have this be on init where
the server sends all the daxdev device information all at once? That
seems less confusing (and better performance-wise) of a flow than
having it be lazily discovered on open, though if I'm misunderstanding
something here please let me know.

I'm not sure how Miklos feels about this, but I think this would get
rid of all the famfs-specific logic in fuse and would be adding
infrastrucutre that other dax-backed servers in the future would use.
On my end, this eases my concerns and would be just as good as what
the bpf approach is trying to accomplish.

There's some ties between your and Darrick's work as you guys are both
using iomap, and maybe/hopefully this aligns with Darrick's thoughts
combining the two, but in my opinion (and maybe Darrick disagrees with
this), to get famfs out the door, we wouldn't need all the code in
Darrick's patchset to land before famfs. In my view, we would only
need to borrow/steal the 'struct fuse_iomap_io' definition in uapi and
hopefully converge on a FUSE_IOMAP_CONFIG uapi format, for famfs to
land, if you agree this direction makes sense. I think we just need to
get the uapi stuff figured out and everything else could be optimized
in the future post-merge. Darrick, do you agree with this assessment?

John, is this a middle ground you think is reasonable? I know this
whole thing has kind of been a mess with the moving goalposts - if the
above would work for famfs but you're slammed with other work and
don't have the bandwidth to make these changes, I'm happy to help out
with the restructuring if that would be useful.

Yes, I think the bpf overhead is the main uncertainty about whether
this suffices or not for famfs. I understand (from the all caps in
your previous messages :)) that performance is critical. The bpf
overhead could indeed be too much for the special famfs performance
critical path. I'll try to get some time next week to benchmark this.
