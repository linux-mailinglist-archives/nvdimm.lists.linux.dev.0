Hi Ben,

I finally got around to actually trying this out on top of Dan's recent fix=
 set
(I rebased it from the cxl/preview branch on kernel.org).

I'm not having much luck actually bring up a region.

The patch set refers to configuring the end point decoders, but all their
sysfs attributes are read only.  Am I missing a dependency somewhere or
is the intent that this series is part of the solution only?

I'm confused!

Jonathan
