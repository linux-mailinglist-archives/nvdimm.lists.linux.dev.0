Agreed.  Other than occasional convenience of doing driver development
in a VM (they reboot quickly ;) can't see why a product system would need
to pass a CXL type 3 device through and as you say security would be 'interesting'
if it were done.  Might be GPU usecases down the line but I'm doubtful on that
as well.
