Golden, thanks Peter!

One more sanity check... So in driver subsystems there are cases where
a device on busA hosts a topology on busB. When that happens there's a
need to set the lock class late in a driver since busA knows nothing
about the locking rules of busB. Since the device has a longer
lifetime than a driver when the driver exits it must set dev->mutex
back to the novalidate class, otherwise it sets up a use after free of
the static lock_class_key. I came up with this and it seems to work,
just want to make sure I'm properly using the lock_set_class() API and
it is ok to transition back and forth from the novalidate case:
