Hi Jonathan. Thanks for reviewing the patches. When I posted the series, 
I haven't tested the code. I just wanted to make sure there are no 
objections to the direction of this enabling going with reusing the 
nvdimm security ops. Once I address Davidlohr and your comments and get 
it fully tested, I'll release v2 w/o RFC.
