Explicit validation at probe in addition to the explicit validation at
the sysfs boundary (as much as possible to report errors early). The
"at probe time" validation does not know if this was a new region, or
one enumerated from LSA or the configuration that the BIOS specified.
So I do expect validation overlap, but there will also be distinct
checks for those different scenarios. For example, see how NVDIMM
validates namespace configuration writes via sysfs, but does not
validate the LSA because it's writing the label and had better be
prepared to read what it writes.

Userspace sense requests, kernel allocates or denies that request
after resolving races with other requesters. Yes, this makes the
interface stateful. Sysfs is not suited to stateless operation.
