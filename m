The regression test will notice. Its primary function is to catch
regressions of this nature.

I changed this to put the size in the table definition directly so it
can be edited there. The intent is for this size to be static / known
to the unit test in advance. I.e. unlike QEMU testing where the test
would need to be told of the configuration that was specified to the
VM.
