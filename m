Sorry for not clear.

What I meant was zram is also used for fs backend storage, not only
for swapbackend. The multiple simultaneous compression can help the case,
too.

That's the my question. What's the reason zram need to know about
kswapd, direct_reclaim and so on? I didn't understand your input.

Okay, then, why should we do that without following normal asynchrnous
disk storage? VM justs put the IO request and sometimes congestion
control. Why is other logic needed for the case?

That's general problem for common resources in the system and always
trace-off domain in the workload areas. Eng folks has tried to tune
them statically/dynamically depending on system behavior considering
what they priorites.

Direct reclaim is already harmful and that's why VM has the logic 
to throttle writeback or other special logics for kswapd or direct
reclaim path for th IO, which could be applied into the zram, too.
