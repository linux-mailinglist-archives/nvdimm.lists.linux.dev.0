...or are you suggesting to represent CXL free memory capacity in
iomem_resource and augment the FW list early with CXL ranges. That
seems doable, but it would only represent the free CXL ranges in
iomem_resource as the populated CXL ranges cannot have their resources
reparented after the fact, and there is plenty of code that expects
"System RAM" to be a top-level resource.
