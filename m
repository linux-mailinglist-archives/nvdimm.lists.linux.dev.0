maybe fsdax may not honor that after removing the pgmap ref count
as we talked earlier in the thread without the memory failures stuff.

But my point earlier on "oversight" was about the fact that we describe
PMD/PUDs with base pages. And hence why we can't do this:

 	page = pud_page(orig) + ((addr & ~PUD_MASK) >> PAGE_SHIFT);
 	refs = record_subpages(page, addr, end, pages + *nr);
 	head = try_grab_compound_head(pud_page(orig), refs, flags);

... For devmap.

The tests I showed are on 16G and 128G (I usually test with > 1Tb).
But we are comparing 1 pgmap lookup, and 512 refcount atomic updates for
a PMD sized pin (2M).

It depends on what you think small is. Maybe for a 4K-16K of memory pinned,
probably the pgmap lookup is more expensive.

A couple months ago I remember measuring xarray lookups and that would be
around ~150ns per lookup with few entries excluding the ref update. I can
be pedantic and give you a more concrete measurement for get_dev_pagemap()
but quite honestly don't think that it will be close with we pin a hugepage.

But this is orthogonal to the pgmap ref existence, I was merely commenting on
the performance aspect.

I understood the question. I was more trying to learn from you  on HMM/P2PDMA
use-cases as you sounded like compound pages exist elsewhere in devmap :)

Yes, correct. (I also verified with similar snippet above to be
extra-pedantic)

I would like to emphasize that it is only OK *after this series*.

Without this series there is neither compound order or head, nor any
compound page whatsoever.

IIUC, Correct. fs/dax code is a little fuzzy on the sector to PFN
translation but still:

There's no compound pages in fsdax (neither do I add them). So
compound_order() doesn't exist (hence order 0) and there's no head
which also means that compound_head(@page) returns @page (which is
a tad misleading on being a head definition as a PMD subpage would
not return @page).

I wasn't going to have that pmd_val() in there. Just this refcount part:

 	page = pud_page(orig) + ((addr & ~PUD_MASK) >> PAGE_SHIFT);
 	refs = record_subpages(page, addr, end, pages + *nr);
 	head = try_grab_compound_head(pud_page(orig), refs, flags);

and __gup_device_huge() melded in.

I am gonna translate that into HMM and P2PDMA so far aren't affected as you
also said earlier above. Even after Logan's P2PDMA NVME series it appears is
always PTEs. So fsdax and device-dax are the only pmd_devmap users we
should care, and for pud_devmap() only device-dax.

/me nods.

Also, it's not that PMDs span compound heads, it's that PMDs/PUDs use
just base pages. Compound pages/head in devmap are only introduced by
series and for device-dax only.
