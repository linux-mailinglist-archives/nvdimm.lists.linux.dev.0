Yes but the mapping interface should be *generic*, not one that is so
specifically tailored to one server. fuse will have to support this
forever.

I don't think the problem is the command field. As I understand it, if
this lands and is converted over later, none of the famfs code in this
series can be removed from fuse. If fuse has native non-bpf support
for famfs, then it will always need to have that. That's the part that
worries me.

I think maybe there is a misinterpretation of what the alternative
approach entails. From my point of view, the alternative approach is
not that different from what is already in this series. The only piece
of the famfs logic that would need to use bpf is the logic for
finding/computing the extent mappings (which is the famfs-specific
logic that would not be applicable to any other server). That famfs
bpf code is minimal and already written [1], as it is just the logic
that is in patch 6 [2] in this series copied over. No other part of
famfs touches bpf. The rest is renaming the functions in
fs/fuse/famfs.c to generic fuse_iomap_dax_XXX names (the logic is the
same logic in this series, eg invoking the lower-level calls to
dax_iomap_rw/fault/etc) and moving the daxdev setup/initialization to
connection initialization time where the server passes that daxdev
setup info/configs upfront. I don't think this would delay things by
several merge windows, as the code is already mostly written. If it
would be helpful, I can clean up what's in the prototype and send that
out.

I think the part that is not clear yet and needs to be verified is
whether this approach runs into any technical limitations on famfs's
production workloads. For example, does the overhead of using bpf maps
lead to a noticeable performance drop on real workloads? In the
future, will there be too many extent mappings on high-scale systems
to make this feasible? etc. If there are technical reasons why the
famfs logic has to be in fuse, then imo we should figure that out and
ideally that's the discussion we should be having. I am not a cxl
expert so perhaps there is something missing in the approach that
makes it not sufficient on production systems. If we don't end up
going with the alternative approach, I still think this series should
try to make the famfs uapi additions to fuse as generic as possible
since that will be irreversible.

If we expedited the alternative approach in terms of reviewing and
merging, would that suffice? Is the main pushback the timing of it, eg
that it would take too long to get reviewed, merged, and shipped?

It doesn't avoid the expansion of the UABI but it makes the UABI
generic (eg plenty of future servers can/will use the generic iomap
layer).

bpf is used elsewhere in the kernel (eg networking, scheduling). If it
is the case that it is unsafe (which maybe it is, I don't know), then
wouldn't those other areas have the same issues?

I think what fuse4fs needs for bpf is significantly more complicated
and intensive than what famfs needs. For famfs, the extent mapping
logic is straightforward computation.

I recognize this is an unfair situation John as you've already spent
years working on this and did what the community asked with rewriting
it. What I'm hoping to convey is that the approach where the extent
computing/finding logic gets moved to bpf is not radically different
from the famfs logic already in this patchset. In my view, moving this
logic to bpf is more advantageous for both fuse *and* famfs
(decoupling famfs releases from kernel releases) - it would be great
to consider this on technical merits if expediting the timeline of the
alternative approach would suffice.

Thanks,
