It should know because the MCE that unmapped the page will have
communicated a "whole_page()" MCE. When dax_recovery_read() goes to
consult the badblocks list to try to read the remaining good data it
will see that every single cacheline is covered by badblocks, so
nothing to read, and no need to establish the UC mapping. So the the
"Tony fix" was incomplete in retrospect. It neglected to update the
NVDIMM badblocks tracking for the whole page case.

It's really not a question of UC vs NP, it's a question of accurately
tracking how many cachelines are clobbered in an MCE event so that
hypervisors can punch out entire pages from any future guest access.
This also raises another problem in my mind, how does the hypervisor
learn that the poison was repaired? Presumably the "Tony fix" was for
a case where the guest thought the page was still accessible, but the
hypervisor wanted the whole thing treated as poison. It may be the
case that we're missing a mechanism to ask the hypervisor to consider
that the guest has cleared the poison. At least for PMEM described by
ACPI the existing ClearError DSM in the guest could be trapped by the
hypervisor to handle this case, but I'm not sure what to do about
guests that later want to use MOVDIR64B to clear errors.
