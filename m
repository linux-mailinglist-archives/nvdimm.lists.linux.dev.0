Aaaha, that's that innocent-looking pfn_to_online_page() call there in
memory_failure() which would return NULL for pmem/dax pages.

I see.

Sounds good.

Probably something similar to patrol scrubbing on normal DRAM.

Hmm, so looking at this more:

        else
                rc = set_memory_uc(decoy_addr, 1);

->  memtype_reserve(__pa(addr), __pa(addr) + numpages * PAGE_SIZE,

->  memtype_reserve(__pa(addr), __pa(addr) + 1,

Looking at

  17fae1294ad9 ("x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is affected and poisoned")

it says

    Fix is to check the scope of the poison by checking the MCi_MISC register.
    If the entire page is affected, then unmap the page. If only part of the
    page is affected, then mark the page as uncacheable.

so I guess for normal DRAM we still want to map the page uncacheable so
that other parts except that cacheline can still be read.

And PMEM should be excluded from that treatise here because it needs to
be WB, as you said earlier.

Right?
