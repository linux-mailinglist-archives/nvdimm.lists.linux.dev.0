Sorry my english keeps getting broken, I meant this instead:

But naming aside, what I am trying to get at is to remove the second geometry value
validation i.e. for @geometry to not be validated a second time to be set to DEVMAP_PTE,
DEVMAP_PMD or DEVMAP_PUD.

And I should add:

I can maintain the DEVMAP_* enum values, but then these will need to be changed in tandem
anytime a new @align value is supported. Or instead we use the name @geometry albeit with
still as an unsigned long type . Or rather than an unsigned long perhaps making another
type and its value obtained/changed with getter/setter.
