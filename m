I managed to get something like this to work, and had two pmem devices
shown up.  But of course they don't actually support DAX without a
reconfiguration in the VM, and the #$%$@^$^$ DAX code won't even
tell you about why as the printk for that is a pr_debug (patch to fix
this coming).  After a fair amount of goodling I tried to copy this
command line to reconfigure them:

$NDCTL create-namespace --force --reconfig=namespace0.0 --mode=fsdax --map=mem
$NDCTL create-namespace --force --reconfig=namespace1.0 --mode=fsdax --map=mem

Of course that fails with EINVAL.  And after the first run the second
namespace is gone entirely.  The DAX user story is just a trainwreck.
