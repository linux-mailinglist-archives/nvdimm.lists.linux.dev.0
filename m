+Cc bunch of relevant people. There are discussions underway but I'm not sure
anyone will want to give more details here yet.

This is the only case that's really a problem (to my mind) I hope we will have
a more general solution before there is much hardware out there, particularly
where sharing is involved.

There are significant disadvantages in doing this that I suspect will mean
this never happens for some classes of device, or is turned off for performance
reasons. For anyone curious, go look at the protocol requirements of back
invalidate in the CXL 3.0 spec.
