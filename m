Yeah, we can add document in kernel or somewhere else that dumping to
pmem is dangerous, especially when we want to dump pmem meta. People who
dare use kexec command directly, should handle it by her/his own.

Hmm, we may not need to worry about that. kernel just need to do its own
business, not touching pmem data during kdump jumping and booting, and
provide way to allow makedumpfile to read out pmem meta. Anything else
should be taken care of by user or distros.
