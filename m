A quick followup: I figured out how to parse the table by hand, and sure
enough, the relevant bit is not set.  So ndctl and friends are doing the
right thing.  The issue is either that the platform does not have the
capability we expected or that the NFIT is wrong and not reporting the
capability that the hardware actually provides.

At this point it really does seem to be a manufacturer issue of one kind
or another.
