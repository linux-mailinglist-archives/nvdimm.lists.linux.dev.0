It is not in all cases, as I read:

17fae1294ad9 x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is
affected and poisoned

...it is MSi_MISC that determines what happens and MSi_MISC is not
memory-type aware.

Where would this routine learn the memory type? Pass it in via
memory_failure(), to what end?

I'm sorry, but I'm not tracking.

set_mce_nospec() just wants to prevent speculative consumption of
poison going forward. It has 2 options NP and UC. UC is suitable for
DRAM and desired for PMEM as long as MSi_MISC indicates a sub-page
size poison event.

If you want set_mce_nospec() to specify NP for the page even when
MSi_MISC indicates sub-page blast radius it would require extra
plumbing to convey the memory type to set_mce_nospec().

I fail to see the point of that extra plumbing when MSi_MISC
indicating "whole_page", or not is sufficient. What am I missing?
