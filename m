Thanks, I was also a bit confused, but I think I got it now. Does that mean
that you also plan to relax the pte_devmap(pte) check in follow_page_pte(),
before calling get_dev_pagemap() in the slow path? So that it could also be
called for pte_special(), maybe with additional vma_is_dax() check. And then
rely on get_dev_pagemap() finding the pages for those "very special" PTEs that
actually would have struct pages (at least for s390 DCSS with DAX)?
