I'm not sure that's true when we mmap().  Yes, it's not consistent with
-EIO from read(), but we have additional information here, and it's worth
providing it.  You can think of it as *in this instance*, the error is
found "in the page cache", because that's effectively where the error
is from the point of view of the application?
