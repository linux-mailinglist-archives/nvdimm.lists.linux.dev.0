Changes since v3 [1]:
- Rebase on the cxl-for-5.15 tag where some of v3 was accepted.

- Move the introduction of the uuid_to_nvdimm_cclass() helper to the
  patch that uses it to avoid a "defined but not used" warning (now
  fatal as of the -Werror upstream change).

- Fix the kernel-doc for the new CXL structure definitions in
  drivers/nvdimm/label.h. This resulted in a lead-in patch to fix up
  existing kernel-doc warnings. (Jonathan)

- Move the cxl_mem_get_partition_info() cleanups to their own patch
  (Jonathan).

- Fix the cxl_mem_get_partition_info() kernel-doc (Ben)

- Move the idr.h include fixup to its own patch (Jonathan)

- Fix the kernel-doc for struct cxl_mbox_cmd (Jonathan)

- Add a note about the ABI implications of the nvdimm-bridge device-name
  change (Jonathan)

- Squash "cxl/core: Replace devm_cxl_add_decoder() with non-devm
  version" into "cxl/core: Split decoder setup into alloc + add"

- Cleanup some pointless cxlm->dev to pci_dev and back conversions
  (Jonathan)

- Drop pci.h include from core/mbox.c (Jonathan)

- Drop duplicate cxl_doorbell_busy() and CXL_MAILBOX_TIMEOUT_MS
  definitions, only pci.c needs them. (Jonathan)

- Fix style violation in cxl_for_each_cmd() (Jonathan)

- Move cxl_mem_create() api change to "cxl/pci: Make 'struct cxl_mem'
  device type generic" (Jonathan)

- Add a helper, decoder_populate_targets(), for initializing a decoder
  target_list (Jonathan)

- Use put_unaligned() for potential unaligned write in
  cxl_pmem_set_config_data() (Jonathan)

- Add cxl_nvdimm_remove() to explicitly handle exclusive command
  shutdown rather than some gymnastics to handle the
  devm_add_action_or_reset() error code vs nvdimm_create() failure.
  (Jonathan)

- Switch to platform_device_unregister() lest we wake the dragons
  guarding platform_device_del(). (Jonathan)

- Fix CEL retrieval for the case where CEL is larger than payload_size
  in mock_get_log(). (Jonathan)

- Move CFMWS size definition out of the setup code and into the static
  table definition directly. (Jonathan)

As mentioned in patch 17 in this series the response of upstream QEMU
community to CXL device emulation has been underwhelming to date. Even
if that picked up it still results in a situation where new driver
features and new test capabilities for those features are split across
multiple repositories.

The "nfit_test" approach of mocking up platform resources via an
external test module continues to yield positive results catching
regressions early and often. So this attempts to repeat that success
with a "cxl_test" module to inject custom crafted topologies and command
responses into the CXL subsystem's sysfs and ioctl UAPIs.

The first target for cxl_test to verify is the integration of CXL with
LIBNVDIMM and the new support for the CXL namespace label + region-label
format. The 6 patches in this series finish off the work that was merged
for the v5.15 merge window to introduce support for the new label
format.

The next 10 patches rework the CXL PCI driver to move more common
infrastructure into the core for the unit test environment to reuse. The
largest change here is disconnecting the mailbox command processing
infrastructure from the PCI specific transport. The unit test
environment replaces the PCI transport with a custom backend with mocked
responses to command requests.

Patch 17 introduces just enough mocked functionality for the cxl_acpi
driver to load against cxl_test resources. Patch 21 fixes the first bug
discovered by this framework, namely that HDM decoder target list maps
were not being filled out.

Finally patches 19 and 20 introduce a cxl_test representation of memory
expander devices. In this initial implementation these memory expander
targets implement just enough command support to pass the basic driver
init sequence and enable label command passthrough to LIBNVDIMM.

The topology of cxl_test includes:
- (4) platform fixed memory windows. One each of a x1-volatile,
  x4-volatile, x1-persistent, and x4-persistent.
- (4) Host bridges each with (2) root ports
- (8) CXL memory expanders, one for each root port
- Each memory expander device supports the GET_SUPPORTED_LOGS, GET_LOG,
  IDENTIFY, GET_LSA, and SET_LSA commands.

Going forward the expectation is that where possible new UAPI visible
subsystem functionality comes with cxl_test emulation of the same.

The build process for cxl_test is:

    make M=tools/testing/cxl
    make M=tools/testing/cxl modules_install

The implementation methodology of the test module is the same as
nfit_test where the bulk of the emulation comes from replacing symbols
that cxl_acpi and the cxl_core import with mocked implementation of
those symbols. See the "--wrap=" lines in tools/testing/cxl/Kbuild. Some
symbols need to be replaced, but are local to the modules like
match_add_root_ports(). In those cases the local symbol is marked __weak
(via __mock) with a strong implementation coming from
tools/testing/cxl/. The goal being to be minimally invasive to
production code paths.
