It's more than a preference. I think there are fundamental recovery
scenarios where the kernel needs userspace help to resolve decoder /
DPA assignment and conflicts.

PMEM interleaves behave similarly to RAID where you have multiple
devices in a set that can each fail independently, and because they
are hotplug capable the chances of migrating devices from one system
to another are higher than PMEM devices today where hotplug is mostly
non-existent. If you lurk on linux-raid long enough you will
inevitably encounter someone coming to the list saying, "help a drive
in my RAID array was dying. I managed to save it off, help me
reassemble my array". The story often gets worse when they say "I
managed to corrupt my metadata block, so I don't know what order the
drives are supposed to be in". There are several breadcrumbs and trial
and error steps that one takes to try to get the data back online:
https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_Recovery.

Now imagine that scenario with CXL where there are additional
complicating factors like label-storage-area can fail independently of
the data area, there are region labels with HPA fields that mandate
assembly at a given address, decoders must be programmed in increasing
DPA order, volatile memory and locked/fixed decoders complicate
decoder selection. Considering all the ways that CXL region assembly
can fail it seems inevitable that someone will get into a situation
where they need to pick the decoder and the DPA to map while also not
clobbering the LSA. I.e. I see a "CXL Recovery" wiki in our future.

The requirements that I think fall out from that are:

1/ Region assembly needs to be possible without updating labels. So,
in contrast to the way that nvdimm does it, instead of updating the
region label on every attribute write there would be a commit step
that realizes the current region configuration in the labels, or is
ommitted in recovery scenarios where you are not ready to clobber the
labels.

2/ Userspace needs the flexibility to be able to select/override which
DPA gets mapped in which decoder (kernel would handle DPA skip).

All the ways I can think of to augment the ABI to allow for this style
of recovery devolve to just assigning decoders to regions in the first
instance.
