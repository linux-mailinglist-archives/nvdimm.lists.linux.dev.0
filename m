I'm missing a lot of context here.  But that whole uuid/guid thing is
a little complex:

 - for userspace APIs and on-disk formats a uuid is nothing but a blob
 - userspace historically has its own library to deal with this (libuuid),
   which defines a uuid_t itself.

So instead of trying to build abstractions that somehow word in diferent
software ecosystems I think just treating it as the blob that it is for
exchange makes life easіer for everyone.  It also really makes definitions
of on-disk structures more clear when using the raw bytes instead of a
semi-opaque typedef.
