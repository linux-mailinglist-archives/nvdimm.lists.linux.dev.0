For this particular feature should just be mainline QEMU now.
Switch support was picked up a few days ago and I haven't pushed out a rebase
on top of that yet. Famous last words, but I don't 'think' that anything
that isn't yet in upstream QEMU should effect the region code.

I am testing on ARM (which requires the arch and board support which is
awaiting review) but doubt that causes this problem...
