So what paths can actually cause this to fail? Looking at the upstream
code in init_hdm_decoder() looks like there are only a few things that
are checked. 

base or size being all fs or interleave ways not being a value the
kernel understands.

For all fs, I'm not sure how we'd get that value?

For interleave ways:
Our current verification of writes to these registers in QEMU is very
limited I think you can currently push in an invalid value. We are only
masking writes, not checking for mid range values that don't exist.
However, that's something I'll be looking to restrict soon as we add
more input verification so I wouldn't rely on it.

I'm not aware of anything general affecting QEMU devices emulation.
I've hacked cases in as temporary tests but not sure
we'd want to carry something specific for this one.
