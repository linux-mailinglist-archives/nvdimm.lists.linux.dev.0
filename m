That is not the only discrepancy, but it can certainly be one of them.

I do think, at a certain latency/bandwidth level, memory becomes
"Specific Purpose" - because the performance implications become so
dramatic that you cannot allow just anything to land there.

In my head, I've been thinking about this list

1) Plain old memory (<100ns)
2) Kinda slower, but basically still memory (100-300ns)
3) Slow Memory (>300ns, up to 2-3us loaded latencies)
4) Types 1-3, but with a special feature (Such as compression)
5) Coherent Accelerator Memory (various interconnects now exist)
6) Non-coherent Shared Memory and PMEM (FAMFS, Optane, etc)

Originally I was considering [3,4], but with Alistar's comments I am
also thinking about [5] since apparently some accelerators already
toss their memory into the page allocator for management.


Re: Slow memory --

   Think >500-700ns cache line fetches, or 1-2us loaded.

   It's still "Basically just memory", but the scenarios in which
   you can use it transparently shrink significantly.  If you can
   control what and how things can land there with good policy,
   this can still be a boon compared to hitting I/O.

   But you still want things like reclaim and compaction to run
   on this memory, and you still want buddy-allocation of this memory.

Re: Compression

  This is a class of memory device which presents "usable memory"
  but which carries stipulations around its use.

  The compressed case is the example I use in this set.  There is an
  inline compression mechanism on the device.  If the compression ratio
  drops to low, writes can get dropped resulting in memory poison.

  We could solve this kind of problem only allowing allocation via
  demotion and hack off the Write-bit in the PTE. This provides the
  interposition needed to fend-off compression ratio issues.

  But... it's basically still "just memory" - you can even leave it
  mapped in the CPU page tables and allow userland to read unimpeded.

  In fact, we even want things like compaction and reclaim to run here.
  This cannot be done *unless* this memory is in the page allocator,
  and basically necessitates reimplementing all the core services the
  kernel provides.

Re: Accelerators

  Alistair has described accelerators onlining their memory as NUMA
  nodes being an existing pattern (apparently not in-tree as far as I
  can see, though).

  General consensus is "don't do this" - and it should be obvious
  why.  Memory pressure can cause non-workload memory to spill to
  these NUMA nodes as fallback allocation targets.

  But if we had a strong isolation mechanism, this could be supported.
  I'm not convinced this kind of memory actually needs core services
  like reclaim, so I will wait to see those arguments/data before I
  conclude whether the idea is sound.

The core of this series is not the GFP flag, it is the splitting of
(cpuset.mems_allowed) into (cpuset.mems_allowed, cpuset.sysram_nodes)

That is the nodemask infrastructure improvement.  The GFP flag is one
mechanism of loosening the validation logic from limiting allocations
from (sysram_nodes) to including all nodes present in (mems_allowed).

This patch set does that (cpuset.sysram_nodes and mt_sysram_nodemask)

I describe in the response to David that this is possible, but creates
extreme tripping hazards for a large swath of existing software.

snippet
'''
Simple answer:  We can choose how hard this guardrail is to break.

This initial attempt makes it "Hard":
   You cannot "accidentally" allocate SPM, the call must be explicit.

Removing the GFP would work, and make it "Easier" to access SPM memory.

This would allow a trivial 

   mbind(range, SPM_NODE_ID)

Which is great, but is also an incredible tripping hazard:

   numactl --interleave --all

and in kernel land:

   __alloc_pages_noprof(..., nodes[N_MEMORY])

These will now instantly be subject to SPM node memory.
'''

There are many places that use these patterns already.

But at the end of the day, it is preference: we can choose to do that.

This patch set implements exactly what you describe:

   mems_allowed = possible

It's a matter of applying an isolation mechanism and then punching an
explicit hole in it.  As it is right now, GFP is "leaky" in that there
are, basically, no walls.  Reclaim even ignored cpuset controls until
recently, and the page_alloc code even says to ignore cpuset when 
in an interrupt context.

The core of the proposal here is to provide a strong isolation mechanism
and then allow punching explicit holes in it.  The GFP flag is one
pattern, I'm open to others.
