No, I don't think so.  Bit errors do happen in all media, which is
why devices are built to handle them.  It is just the Intel-style
pmem interface to handle them which is completely broken.

Well, my point is doing recovery from bit errors is by definition not
the fast path.  Which is why I'd rather keep it away from the pmem
read/write fast path, which also happens to be the (much more important)
non-pmem read/write path.
