Okay. It might save us some back and forth if you could outline everything you'd
expect to be validated, but I can also make an attempt to figure out the
reasonable set of things.

It was meant to be relative. I can make it absolute if that's preferable but the
physical base is known at the decoder level already.

Since this is the configuration part of the ABI, I'd rather add that information
when the plumbing to report them exists. I'm struggling to understand the
balance (as mentioned also earlier in this mail thread) as to what userspace
does and what the kernel does. I will add these as you request.

Okay. Since we're moving toward making the sysfs ABI stateful, would you like me
to make the attrs only visible when they can actually be set?

The idea behind this was to give the reviewer somewhat of a bigger picture as to
how things should work in the code rather than in a commit message. I will
remove this.

This needs some work. The concern I have is region operations will need to
operate on memdevs/decoders at various points in time. When the memdev goes
away, the region will also need to go away. None of that plumbing was in place
in v3 and the reference on the memdev was just a half-hearted attempt at doing
the right thing.

For now if you prefer I remove the reference, but perhaps the decoder reference
would buy us some safety?

Initially my thought here is that this is a problem for userspace to deal with.
If userspace can't figure out how to synchronously configure and bind the
region, that's not a kernel problem. However, we've put some effort into
protecting userspace from itself in the create ABI, so it might be more in line
to do that here.

In summary, I'm fine to add it, but I think I really need to get more in your
brain about the userspace/kernel divide sooner rather than later.

Okay. One of the earlier versions did this implicitly since the #ways was needed
to create the region. I thought from the ABI perspective, flexibility was good.
Userspace may choose not to utilize it.

iirc that broke the 80 character limit so I opted to do it this way. I can
change it.

I might have messed it up, but I didn't seem to run into an issue. With the
driver bound check though, it can go away.

I think it would be really good to add this kind of detail to sysfs.rst. Quick
grep finds me arm64/kernel/mte and the nfit driver taking the device lock in an
attr.

I think show_target should just return the chosen decoder and then the decoder
attributes will tell the rest, wouldn't they?

Per above, I think making this decoders makes sense. I could make it flexible
for ease of use, like if you specify memX, the kernel will pick a decoder for
you however I suspect you won't like that.

Would remove() be more appropriate?
