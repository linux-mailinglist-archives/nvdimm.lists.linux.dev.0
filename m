I have an RFC for that - but I haven't had time to update and re-test it.

If you need this, and have a platform where it can be implemented, please get in touch
with the people that look after the specs to move it along from alpha.

It's intended to remove any cached entries - including lines in what the arm-arm calls
"invisible" system caches, which typically only platform firmware can touch. The next
access should have to go all the way to the media. (I don't know enough about CXL to say
what a remote shared memory consumer observes)

Without it, all we have are the by-VA operations which are painfully slow for large
regions, and insufficient for system caches.

As with all those firmware interfaces - its for the platform implementer to wire up
whatever is necessary to remove cached content for the specified range. Just because there
is an (alpha!) spec doesn't mean it can be supported efficiently by a particular platform.

That is to allow some ranges to fail. (e.g. you can do this to the CXL windows, but not
the regular DRAM).

On the less painful implementation, arm's interconnect has a gadget that does "Address
based flush" which could be used here. I'd hope platforms with that don't need to
interrupt all CPUs - but it depends on what else needs to be done.
