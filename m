We've been using a "start time" in
https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-test for many years and it's been
only "OK", not great. I did not know about the $SECONDS magic variable
at the time, otherwise I would have tried it in sof-test! The main
advantage of $SECONDS: there is nothing to do, meaning there is no
"cxl_common_start()" to forget or do wrong. Speaking of which: I tested
this patch on the _entire_ ndctl/test, not just with --suite=cxl whereas
https://lore.kernel.org/all/d76c005105b7612dc47ccd19e102d462c0f4fc1b.1701143039.git.alison.schofield@intel.com/
seems to have a CXL-specific "cxl_common_start()" only?

Also, in my experience some sort of short COOLDOWN is always necessary
anyway for various reasons:
- Some tests can sometimes have "after shocks" and a cooldown helps
  with most of these.
- A short gap in the logs really help with their _readability_.
- Clocks can shift, especially inside QEMU (I naively tried to increase
  the number of cores in run_qemu.sh but had to give up due so "clock skew")
- Others I probably forgot.

On my system, the average, per-test duration is about 10s and I find that
10% is an acceptable price to pay for the peace of mind. But a starttime
should hopefully work too, at least for the majority of the time.

Yes it does, I tried to explain that but afraid my English wasn't good
enough?

Q.E.D ;-)

Yes, this is the main purpose. The other feature is failing when
any of the _expected_ ERROR or WARNING is not found.

> And then can we simply add dev_dbg() messages to fail if missing.

I'm afraid you just lost me at this point... my patch already does that
without any dev_dbg()...?

I agree: the expected "poison inject" and "poison clear" messages should
be in the kmsg_fail_if_missing array[], not in the kmsg_no_fail_on[]
array. BUT in my experience this makes cxl-poison.sh fail when run
multiple times.  So yes: there seems to be a problem with this test.  (I
should probably file a bug somewhere?) So I put them in
kmsg_fail_if_missing[] for now because I don't have time to look into it
now and I don't think a problem in a single test should hold back the
improvement for the entire suite that exposes it. Even with just
kmsg_no_fail_on[], this test is still better than now.

BTW this is a typical game of whack-a-mole every time you try to tighten
a test screw. In SOF it took 4-5 years to finally catch all firmware
errors: https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-test/issues/297

I agree the COOLDOWN / starttime is a separate feature. But... I needed it
for the tests to pass! I find it important to keep the tests all passing
in every commit for bisectability etc., hope you agree. Also, really hard
to submit anything that does not pass the tests :-)

As of now, the tests tolerate cross-test pollution. Being more
demanding when inspecting the logs obviously makes them fail, at least
sometimes. I agree the "timing" solution should go first, so here's
a suggested plan:

1. a) Either I resubmit my COOLDOWN alone,
   b) or you generalize your cxl_common_start()/starttime to non-CXL tests.

No check_dmesg() change yet. "cxl_check_dmesg()" is abandoned forever.

Then:

2. I rebase and resubmit my kmsg_no_fail_on=...

This will give more time for people to try and report any issue in the
timing fix 1. - whichever is it.

In the 1.a) case, I think your [cxl_]common_start() de-duplication is
99% independent and can be submitted at any point.


Thoughts?

PS: keep in mind I may be pulled in other priorities at any time :-(
