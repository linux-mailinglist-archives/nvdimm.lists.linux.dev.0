I've forgotten what our policy on spec references in new
code. Maybe update them to 3.2?

A few tiny little things inline from a fresh look.

Set these at declaration..

With the above set at declaration this is then not declaration
mid code which are still generally looked at in a funny way in kernel!

Maybe move the declaration up and just assign it here.

Perhaps a comment here that the other values don't apply to the
normal mailbox interface (they are FM only).
Might avoid confusion.

counted_by marking always nice to have and here it's the extent_list_size I think
(which has an odd name giving it is a count, not a size... *dramatic sigh*)
