Sure, I should probably include this following note in all patches
touching the DAX-memory_failure() path, because it is a frequently
asked question. The tl;dr is:

Typical memory_failure() does not assume the physical page can be
recovered and put back into circulation, PMEM memory_failure() allows
for recovery of the page.

The longer description is:
Typical memory_failure() for anonymous, or page-cache pages, has the
flexibility to invalidate bad pages and trigger any users to request a
new page from the page allocator to replace the quarantined one. DAX
removes that flexibility. The page is a handle for a fixed storage
location, i.e. no mechanism to remap a physical page to a different
logical address. Software expects to be able to repair an error in
PMEM by reading around the poisoned cache lines and writing zeros,
fallocate(...FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE...), to overwrite poison. The page
needs to remain accessible to enable recovery.

PMEM is mapped WB at the beginning of time for nominal operation.
track_pfn_remap() records that driver setting and forwards it to any
track_pfn_insert() of the same pfn, i.e. this is how DAX mappings
inherit the WB cache mode. memory_failure() wants to arrange avoidance
speculative consumption of poison, set_memory_uc() checks with the
track_pfn_remap() setting, but we know this is an exceptional
condition and it is ok to force it UC against the typical memtype
expectation.

Short answer, PMEM never goes "offline" because it was never "online"
in the first place. Where "online" in this context is specifically
referring to pfns that are under the watchful eye of the core-mm page
allocator.
