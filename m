Thank you, Dan!  The table in question is, I believe, the NFIT (NVDIMM
Firmware Information Table).  I can see a dump of all 488 bytes of it,
though I am not certain how to pick it apart.  Still, it would seem
that, if this system really *does* support persistence_domain:cpu_cache,
the NFIT is not set up correctly by the vendor.  However, I do wonder,
with technology like this, how much of what's going on lies on Intel's
side in terms of what the P200 boards report and how much on Dell's
side.  How these lower-level pieces go together and are configured lies
beyond my current education :-) ...

I await the Dell engineers' response to my queries.

Regards - Eliot
