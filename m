How about:

CXL devices may support both volatile and persistent memory capacity.
The amount of device capacity set aside for each type is typically
established at the factory, but some devices also allow for dynamic
re-partitioning, add a command for this purpose.

It's unfortunate that the specification kept the word "info" in the
set-partition command name, let's leave it out of this name and just
call this 'cxl set-partition'.

Some users will come to this tool with the thought, "I want volatile
capacity X", others "I want pmem capacity Y". All but the most
advanced users will not understand how the volatile setting affects
the pmem and vice versa, nor will they understand that capacity might
be fixed and other capacity is dynamic. So how about a set of options
like:

-t, --type=3D<volatile,pmem>
-s,--size=3D<size>

...where by default -t is 'pmem' and -s is '0' for 100% of the dynamic
capacity set to PMEM.

The tool can then help the user get what they want relative to
whatever frame of reference led them to read the set-partition man
page. The tool can figure out the details behind the scenes, or warn
them if they want something impossible like setting PMEM capacity to
1GB on a device where 2GB of PMEM is statically allocated.

This also helps with future proofing in case there are other types
that come along.

This is "--volatile_size" in the current patch, but that's moot with
feedback to move to a --type + --size scheme.

This a static 256M, that can just be documented here.

...but rather than teaching the user to input valid values, tell them
the validation and translation the tool will do on their behalf with
the input based on type and the details they don't need to worry
about.
