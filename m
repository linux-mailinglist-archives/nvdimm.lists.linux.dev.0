I don't think we need to, or it's broken if the driver load order
matters. The nvdimm enabling code is an example of how to handle this.
The cxl_nvdimm object can be registered before the cxl_nvdimm_bridge,
or after, does not matter. If the cxl_nvdimm comes first it will
trigger the cxl_nvdimm_driver to load. The cxl_nvdimm_driver.probe()
routine finds no bridge present and probe() returns with a failure.
When the bridge arrives it does a rescan  of the cxl_bus_type device
list and if it finds a cxl_nvdimm it re-triggers
cxl_nvdimm_driver.probe(). This time through cxl_nvdimm_driver.probe()
finds the bridge and registers the real nvdimm on the nvdimm_bus.

I think this means that the devm_cxl_add_port() would be triggered by
cxl_memdev_driver.probe() if and only if the parent pci_device of the
CXL endpoint is listed as a dport. If the cxl_memdev is registered
first the search it will search for the CXL root port on the
cxl_bus_type device list. If that fails then cxl_memdev_driver.probe()
fails. If that succeeds it asks the root to scan to the CXL endpoint
parent pci_device and return the confirmation that it is registered as
a dport. If that fails then the device is plugged into a pure PCIe
slot.

When cxl_acpi loads it retriggers all cxl_memdev_driver.probe() to
reconsider all cxl_memdev instances that failed to probe previously.

I *think* I worked that out above, but yes please do poke at it to see
if it holds up.
