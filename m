A valid question, indeed I neglected to clarify the original
motivation to go this route. So a small bit of history: ndctl was
built to be Linux native and vendor agnostic, and ipmctl was built to
be OS agnostic and vendor specific. For that reason ipmctl was slower
to be picked up by distributions and some distributions still do not
ship it in their supported repos today.

One of the feedback items we, ndctl + ipmctl developers, heard is that
ndctl is easier for a distribution to support because of its
organization as a Linux-native open-source project, i.e. no OS
abstraction + typical open development on a public mailing list. We
also heard the feedback that ndctl was frustratingly deficient in
being able to handle all the major provisioning flows for DDR-T
devices except for "goal" / region management.

I think that's a reasonable position. If a distribution is already
comfortable shipping and supporting ipmctl then there's little need to
ship this new tool. Conversely if a distribution has not promoted
ipmctl to a supported package this new tool can fill a gap.

Again, this gets better for CXL where all provisioning is standardized
across vendors.

Understood, I can see how this new tool requires a decision to be made
about whether to ignore it, or ship both for distributions that are
already carrying ipmctl. I don't have a strong opinion either way, I
just know that this option is something that some distributions may
want.
