Well, maybe not. I.e. I don't think it would be out of the question to
wrap this common sequence into a helper that both cxl_pci and
cxl_mock_mem share:

        rc = cxl_mem_enumerate_cmds(cxlm);
        if (rc)
                return rc;

        rc = cxl_mem_identify(cxlm);
        if (rc)
                return rc;

        rc = cxl_mem_create_range_info(cxlm);
        if (rc)
                return rc;

        cxlmd = devm_cxl_add_memdev(dev, cxlm);
        if (IS_ERR(cxlmd))
                return PTR_ERR(cxlmd);

        if (range_len(&cxlm->pmem_range) && IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_CXL_PMEM))
                rc = devm_cxl_add_nvdimm(dev, cxlmd);

...or are you thinking of a different place where there's duplication?
