If you define "How should virtio consume an extent" and "How should
FAMFS consume an extent" as "Policy" I can see your argument, and we
should address this.

I view "All things shall route through DAX" as "A policy" that
dictates cxl-driven changes to dax - including new dax drivers
(see: famfs new dax mechanism).

So we're already there.  Might as well reduce the complexity (as
explained below) and cut out dax where it makes sense rather than
force everyone to eat DAX (for potentially negative value).

This is fair, we don't want infinite drivers - and many use cases
(we imagine) will end up using DAX - I'm not arguing to get rid of the
dax driver.

There are at least 3 or 4 use-cases i've seen so far

- dax (dev and fs): can share a driver w/ DAXDRV_ selection

- sysram : preferably doing direct hotplug - not via dax
           private-ram may re-use this cleanly with some config bits

- virtio : may not even want to expose objects to userland
           may prefer to simply directly interact with a VMM
	   dax may present a security issue if reconfig'd to device

- type-2 : may have wildly different patterns and preferences
           may also end up somewhat generalized

I think trying to pump all of these through dax and into userland by
default is a mistake - if only because it drives more complexity.

We should get form from function.

Example: for sysram - dax_kmem is just glue, the hotplug logic should
         live in cxl and operate directly on extents.  It's simpler and
	 doesn't add a bunch of needless dependencies.

Consider a hot-unplug request

Current setup
----
FM -> Host
   1) Unplug Extent A
Host
   2) cxl: hotunplug(dax_map[A])
   3) dax: Does this cover the entire dax? (no->reject, yes->unplug())
      - might fail due to dax-reasons
      - might fail due to normal hot-unplug reasons
   4) unbind dax
   5) return extent

Dropping Dax in favor of sysram doing direct hotplug
----
FM -> Host
   1) Unplug Extent A 
Host
   2) hotunplug(extents_map[A])
      - might fail because of normal hot-unplug reasons
   3) return extent

It's just simpler and gives you the option of complete sparseness
(untagged extents) or tracking related extents (tagged extents).

This pattern may not carry over the same with dax or virtio uses.

yeah i think it's pretty clear the dax case wants a daxN.M/uuid of some
kind (we can argue whether it needs to be exposed to userland - but
having some conversations about FAMFS, this sounds userful.

Set(A) = extents that arrive together with the more bit set

So lets say you get two sets that arrive with the same tag (A)
Set(A) + Set(A)'

Set(A)' would get rejected because Set(A) has already arrived.
Otherwise, accepting Set(A)' implies sparseness of Set(A).

Having a tag map to a region is pointless - the HPA maps extent to
region.  So there's no other use for a tag in the sysram case.

On the flip side - assuming you want to try to allow Set(A)+Set(A)'

How userland is expected to know when all extents have arrived if
hotplug cannot occur until all the extents have arrived, and the only
place to put those extents is DAX?  Seems needlessly complex.

This assumes userland has something to build on top of, and moreover
that this something will be DAX.

- I agree for a filesystem-consumption pattern.
- I disagree for hotplug - dax is pointless glue.
- I don't know if DAX is right-fit for other use cases. (it might just
  want to pass the raw IORESOURCE region to the VMM, for example).

Probably not.  And in fact I think that should be one configuration bit
(either you support tags or you don't - reject the other state).

But I can imagine a driver wanting to support either (exclusive-or)

Same driver - allow it to bind PARTMODE_RAM or PARTMODE_DC.

A RAM region hotplugs exactly once: at bind/unbind
A DC region hotplugs at runtime.

Same code, DC just adds the log monitoring stuff.

I would need to think this over a bit more, I'm not quite seeing how
what you are suggesting would work.

N_MEMORY_PRIVATE implies there is some special feature of the device
that should be taken into account when managing the memory - but that
you want to re-use (some of) the existing mm/ infrastructure for basic
operations (page_alloc, reclaim, migration, etc).

There's an argument that some such nodes shouldn't even be visible to
userspace (of what use is knowing a node is there if mempolicy commands
are rejected or ignored if you try to bind to it?)

But also, setting N_MEMORY_PRIVATE vs N_MEMORY would explicitly be an
mm/memory_hotplug.c operation - so there's a pretty long path from
userland to "Setting N_MEMORY_PRIVATE" that goes through the drivers.

You can't set N_MEMORY_PRIVATE before going online (has to be done
during the hotplug process, otherwise you get nasty race conditions).

I guess summarizing the sysram case: The policy seems simple enough to
not warrant over-complicated the infrastructure for the sake of making
dax "The One Interface To Rule Them All".

All userland wants to do for sysram is hot(un)plug.  Why bother with
dax at all?
