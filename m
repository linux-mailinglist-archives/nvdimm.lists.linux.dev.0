Best of luck.

Not if you use memmap= to hack the memory map, that interface is
"garbage in / garbage out" from a safety perspective.

No, the obscurity of APIs for this is deliberate. It's broken outside
of controlled scenarios, not something Linux will ever support in the
general case. See the CXL specification for the hardware capability
required to support memory over PCIe electricals.

Correct, I do not have any recommendations to offer here.
