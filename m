Hee hee indeed. The thing about memory, and dax devices, is that there
isn't anything like device mapper that can make compound or interleaved
devices. There's not a "stop while dma happens" point for swizzling 
addresses. I'm down for a discussion about whether there is a viable way 
to have a mapper layer, but I also think constructing interleaved objects 
as files is quite good - and might be the best solution.

Interleaving is essential to memory performance in general. System-ram is
pretty much never not interleaved. And there are some reasons why programming
the hardware to do the interleaving is gonna be problem for non-static 
setups. I'll save going down that rathole for a different time...
