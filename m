True, but ipmctl also did not make an attempt to support anything
other than Intel devices, and later versions abandoned the namespace
setup code in favor of "native OS" capabilities (ndctl on Linux).

The main rationale for splitting region provisioning to dedicated
tooling is the observation that region provisioning semantics are
platform specific. It is already the case that IBM devices have their
own provisioning tool with different semantics for the "PAPR" family.
CXL region provisioning semantics again are much different than what
is done for DDR-T devices (see below). So rather than try to abstract
all that under ndctl that wants to be vendor agnostic, offload that to
platform specific tools. My hope is that more tools like this do not
proliferate as the industry unifies on common standards for persistent
memory like CXL.

That said, the new commands could be placed under a
vendor/platform-specific name in ndctl, like:

ndctl list-ipm-region
ndctl reconfigure-ipm-region

...just not my first choice given the success to date of keeping
vendor details out of the command line interface of ndctl. The primary
blocker for ndctl to generic region provisioning would be a kernel
driver model for it, but I don't know how to reconcile "ipm-regions"
requiring a reboot and a BIOS validation step vs buses like CXL that
can reconfigure interleave sets at runtime.

Yes, CXL exposes several more details and degrees of freedom to system
software. Before I list those I'll point out that to keep pcdctl
simple it only handles the simple / common configurations: all
performance-pmem (interleaved), all fault tolerant pmem
(non-interleaved), all volatile with memory-side-caching. Any
custom/expert configuration outside of those common cases is punted to
ipmctl. In comparison, the CXL tool will need to handle the full range
of configuration complexity.

The main difference to end users when provisioning regions on CXL is
the wider range of resources they need to consider. The CXL specific
resources include:

- Available PMEM capable address space as described by the ACPI CFMWS

- Device performance that matches the address space traffic class

- Decoder resources at each level of the hierarchy. I.e. a device may
be able to participate in 4 different interleave configurations, but
depending on the switch topology upstream of that device it may be
constrained to a smaller set.

- Volatile memory vs PMEM partitioning on the device. The NVDIMM
sub-system and ndctl will not have any responsibility for the volatile
memory side of CXL.

To me that looks like sufficient complexity to warrant a dedicated CXL
tool rather than try to find a lowest-common-denominator abstraction
that melds with ipm-regions for ndctl to drive generically. The CXL
tool will also handle firmware update and other CXL generic
functionality outside of PMEM.

You mean the complexity of having to determine which platform region
provisioning tool to use before you can use ndctl to do the rest?

How about "ipmregion"? Where "ipm" is already in the wild as an
identifier for DDR-T configuration, and unlike ipmctl it only handles
the region provisioning subset?
