My read is that the guest gets virtual #MC on an access to that page.
When the guest tries to do set_memory_uc() and instructs cpa_flush()
to do clean caches that results in taking another fault / exception
perhaps because the VMM unmapped the page from the guest? If the guest
had flipped the page to NP then cpa_flush() says "oh, no caching
change, skip the clflush() loop".

Yeah, I thought UC would make the PMEM driver's life easier, but if it
has to contend with an NP case at all, might as well make it handle
that case all the time.

Safe to say this patch of mine is woefully insufficient and I need to
go look at how to make the guarantees needed by the PMEM driver so it
can handle NP and set up alias maps.

This was a useful discussion. It proves that my commit:

284ce4011ba6 x86/memory_failure: Introduce {set, clear}_mce_nospec()

...was broken from the outset.
