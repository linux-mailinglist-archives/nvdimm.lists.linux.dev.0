My reading of that thread is that while it started out that way, it
became more about "So what would a good interface be for doing this".  And
Jason's right, he and I are approaching this from different directions.
My concern is from the GUP side where we start out by getting a folio
(which we know is physically contiguous) and decomposing it into pages.
Then we aggregate all those pages together which are physically contiguous
and stuff them into a bio_vec.  After that, I lose interest; I was
planning on having DMA mapping interfaces which took in an array of
phyr and spat out scatterlists.  Then we could shrink the scatterlist
by removing page_link and offset, leaving us with only dma_address,
length and maybe flags.
