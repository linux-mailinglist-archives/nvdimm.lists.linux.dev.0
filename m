<nod> On second thought, there's a way to read Miklos' sentence that I
hadn't thought of before:

"However, with the [fuse-iomap] bpf approach, this [famfs specific
mapping interface] would be gone, which is great."

vs. the way I had thought:

"However, with the bpf approach, this [famfs specific mapping interface]
would be gone [in favor of filling out a struct iomap directly], which
is great."

So maybe Miklos actually /has/ at least read all the way through the
February posting, though I have no data to make such a conclusion. :/

Remember where struct fuse_iomap_io came from -- the fuse-iomap
patchset.  It would be rather odd to start accepting fuse_iomap_io
objects from a user's bpf program without examining the rest of the fuse
iomap stuff.

I agree that you and I and John could probably get the code and review
part wrapped up in perhaps two merge windows -- one for fuse-iomap,
and the second for famfs.  The userspace parts of both are more or less
done, which would minimize the amount of rework when we get to the
libfuse part.

(Let's be honest, with LSFMM happening during the week between -rc2 and
-rc3 and everyone's travel thereto, that's going to blow a big hole in
the 7.2 schedule)

The question is, would Miklos acquiesce to merging a large ball of code
that the three of us have been collaborating on?  Even if he wasn't
deeply involved in that collaboration?

I see a custom hashtable map implementation in kernel/bpf/hashtab.c,
and no particular evidence that it can rehash itself to cut down on
bucket list chasing.  That's too bad, because rhashtable rehashing is
generally effective at keeping the xfs icache pointer chasing down.

If we have a per-inode famfs_file_meta object, I wonder if we could just
attach it to the fuse_inode as a void *private pointer?  That wouldn't
be any worse than current famfs.

I've asked that question (are we going to have millions of mappings?)
before.  From what John has told me and what I've seen with cxl and pmem
devices before that, the memory manager is heavily incentivized to give
out large static(ish) allocations to constrain the metadata overhead,
enable the use of PMD/PGD TLB entries, and minimize pointer chasing
through mapping structures.

The only reason we let that happen in the disk filesystems is that the
IO service times are so high nobody cares about L3 misses.

I think John's been pretty clear that he doesn't want to drag this out
even a day longer.  Given current trends this month, I might run out of
time soon too.

Well ok, here we go -- I don't think there's any serious technical
problems with BPF.  The ability to read (and in some cases write) to
kernel memory looks like it's flexible enough to do the classification
and data collection stuff that most current bpf users want to do.

The issues I was alluding to are BPF being used as a means to get around
slow/unresponsive maintainers; and the kernel community's collective
refusal to explore any other path to building new user APIs besides
designing everything generically perfectly up front in the kernel UABI
along with all the stress that involves.

Once upon a time I tried to push on these UAPI stressfulness issues and
Linus told me I had a loose grip on reality.  He's probably right.

Agreed.  For fuse4fs I'm content to let it manage the iomap cache.
