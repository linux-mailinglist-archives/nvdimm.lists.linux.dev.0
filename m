Excellent coverage - makes sense!  Thank you, Dan.

The issue is this.  When mapping a large region, fsdax will *mostly* use
2Mb pages.  It won't use 1Gb pages at all (that would be an enhancement
request, I suppose), but it strangely decided to do certain 2Mb regions
(which *could* be mapped with a 2Mb huge page) using 4Kb pages.  A
possible clue is that when first mapping the region, it is the *last*
2Mb region that gets split into 4Kb pages.  This suggests some kind of
boundary condition not being handled in the desired way (though the
result still *works*, just with more TLB miss overhead).

Sounds like re-posting the original query to linux-mm and linux-fsdevel
might be appropriate since it has to do with mmaping files on fsdax
file systems.

Best - Eliot
