Mapping interfaces being generic is a nice idea, but I'm no sure it's
realistic in a generalized sense. But other mitigating comments below.

I believe this basic premise is completely wrong. Here is why:

There is a FUSE_DAX_FMAP capability that the kernel may advertise or not
at init time; this capability "is" the famfs GET_FMAP AND GET_DAXDEV 
commands. In the future, if we find a way to use BPF (or some other 
mechanism) to avoid needing those fuse messages, the kernel could be updated 
to NEVER advertise the FUSE_DAX_FMAP capability. All of the famfs-specific 
code could be taken out of kernels that never advertise that capability.

Simple, really. Can't re-use the message opcodes, but as Darrick pointed out
those are not a scarce resource.

Um, advertised capabilities allow contraction of the UABI-handling code with 
only some small cruft. Code that is only reachable in the presence of dead 
capability can totally be removed.

See my long comment to Darrick's prior email.

I suspect that this would be the only place BPF has been tried for a vma
fault handler. That is a special, performance critical path - especially
for famfs. In discussion with the right people we can probably reason
through whether this is a non-starter or not.
