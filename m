I don't mind if it has to because of a good reason X - I'm just trying
to simplify things and not do stuff which is practically unnecessary.

Hmm, so this sounds like more is needed than this small patch.

Ok, so those errors do get reported through MCE so MCE code does need to
know about them.

So the question is, how should MCE mark them so that the driver can deal
with them properly.

See my other mail - that sounds good.

Right, so to reiterate: I don't mind if the MCE code knows about this -
in the end of the day, it is that code which does the error reporting.
My goal is to make that reporting and marking optimal so that the driver
can work with that marking and simplify and document *why* we're doing
that so that future MCE changes can keep that in mind.

So to sum up: it sounds to me like it should simply mark *whole* pages
as NC:

1. this should prevent the spec. access for DRAM.
2. PMEM can do UC alias mapping and do sub-page access to salvage data.

How's that?

Thx.
