I tested an old lock patch yesterday. It really helps a lot.
The lock patch is from this link:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/9/14/280

The test results:
   v7.0-rc5 + (lock patch)                    : improve about %60%
   v7.0-rc5 + (lock patch) + (this patch set) : improve about 130%

Could you tell me the patch about it?
Is this lock patch merged ? or not?

I can test it.

I am afraid even the lock patch resolves the scalability high-core no-numa setups,
we still need to split the i_mmap for NUMA.

Yes. It is orthogonal to your proposal.
