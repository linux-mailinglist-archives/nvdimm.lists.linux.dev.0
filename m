A little strange thing I found:
According to the result.xml, the MKFS_OPTIONS didn't include -m rmapbt=1:
     <property name="MKFS_OPTIONS" value=" -d daxinherit=1,"/>
mkfs.xfs will turn on reflink by default, but won't turn on rmapbt. 
Then xfs/55[0-2] should be "not run" because they have 
_require_xfs_scratch_rmapbt.


Also, this alert message didn't show in my tests:
[ 6047.876110] XFS (pmem1): xlog_verify_grant_tail: space > 
BBTOB(tail_blocks)
But I don't think it is related.

Has it failed again since this time?  If so, please sent me the 
result.xml because it is needed for analyze.  Thank you~

I don't know what does this mean: "selected W=123e warnings".  How could 
I turn on this config?
