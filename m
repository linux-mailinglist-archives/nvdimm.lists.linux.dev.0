I did mean the other way around. The thing that gets tricky if you do it at the
sysfs boundary is you do have to start seeing the interface as stateful. Perhaps
the complexity I see arising from this won't materialize, so I'll try it and
see. It seems like it can get messy quickly though.

Ultimately some checking will need to occur in one form or another in region
probe(). Either explicit via conditional: if (!is_valid(interleave_ways)) return
-EINVAL, or implicitly, for example 1 << (rootd_ig - cxlr_ig) is some invalid
nonsense which later fails host bridge programming verification. Before
discussing further, which are you suggesting?

Okay. I don't have a strong opinion on how userspace should or shouldn't use
this interface. It seems less friendly to do it this way, but per the following
comment, if it's root only, it doesn't really matter.

I was under the impression you expected userspace to manage the DPA as well. I
don't really see any reason why the kernel should manage it if userspace is
already handling all these other bits. Let userspace set the offset and size
(can make a single device attr for it), and upon doing so it gets reserved.

My mistake. I forgot about that.

That's fine. As the interface is today (before your requested changes) only
region->probe() is something that mucks with the physical address layout. It
could theoretically be entirely configured (not bound) by userspace.

Yeah. I will write it once we close this discussion.
