Range E is for existed bad block range, and S is for inserting bad block =
range. So such situation is not handled by behind merge part.

Yes, it is the code block after the following comment,
/* Check whether the following already set range can be merged */

Like what combine_front() does, it tries to merge the ranges in bad =
blocks table into less ones, to avoid potential no-space issue in next =
time _badblocks_set() is called.

Nice catch! I=E2=80=99d like to add a check (prev >=3D 0) after =

I replied in previous patch. front_combine() is to handle a special =
condition, and try to merge more bad block ranges from the bad blocks =
table.

Thanks for your comments. I will post an update version for your further =
code review.
