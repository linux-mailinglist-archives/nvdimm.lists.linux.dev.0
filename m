1) In kernel side, export info of pmem meta data;
2) in makedumpfile size, add an option to specify if we want to dump
   pmem meta data; An option or in dump level?
3) In glue script, detect and warn if pmem data is in pmem and wanted,
   and dump target is the same pmem.

Does this work for you?

Not sure if above items are all do-able. As for parking pmem device
till in kdump kernel, I believe intel pmem expert know how to achieve
that. If there's no way to park pmem during kdump jumping, case D) is
daydream.
