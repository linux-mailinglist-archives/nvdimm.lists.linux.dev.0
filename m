It's great to see progress on this, thanks!  Shipping another utility as
part of the ndctl package is fine with me, though I'm not sure why we
wouldn't just make this an ndctl sub-command.  From a user's
perspective, these are all operations on or about nvdimms.  ipmctl
didn't have separate utilities for provisioning goals and namespace
configuration, for example.

Is there a meaningful difference to the user?  Can you show some
examples of how configuration would be different between cxl-attached
pmem and memory-bus attached pmem?

It's completely fine to ship more tools with ndctl.  I would like a
better overall picture of configuration from the admin's perspective.
At first glance, I think we're adding unneeded complexity.

Cheers,
Jeff

p.s. I don't find the name 'pdctl' particularly endearing.  If we do
stick with a separate utility, I'd suggest coming up with a more
descriptive name.
