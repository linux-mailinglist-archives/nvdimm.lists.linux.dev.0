Hmm. This definitely looks dubious now that I see it again. Let me try to figure
out how to rework it. I think it would be good to ask Dan as well. Much of the
topology relationship works from bottom up, but top down is less easy.
Previously I had used pci-isms to do this but Dan has been working on keeping
the two domains isolated, which I agree is a good idea.

Is this allowed by spec? We shouldn't infinite loop, but I can't imagine the
driver could do anything saner than fail to probe for such a case.
