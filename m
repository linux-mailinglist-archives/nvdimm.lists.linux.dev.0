Guess you are saying scripts in RHEL/centos/fedora, and yes if I guess
righ. Other distros could have different scripts. For kdump, we need
load kdump kernel/initramfs in advance, then wait to capture any crash.
When we load, we can detect and check whether the environment and
setup is expected. If not, we can warn or error out message to users.
We don't need to do the checking until crash is triggered, then decide
to abort the dump or not.

I used parking which should be wrong. When crash happened, we currently
only shutdown unrelated CPU and interupt controller, but keep other
devices on-flight. This is why we can preserve the content of crash-ed
kernel's memory. For normal memory device, we reserve small part as
crashkernel to run kdump kernel and dumping, keep the 1st kernel's
memory untouched. For pmem, we may need to do something similar to keep
its content untouched. I am not sure if disabling pmem device is the
thing we need do in kdump kernel, what we want is
1) not shutdown pmem in 1st kernel when crash-ed
2) do not re-initialize pmem, at least do not remove its content

1) has been there with the current handling. We need do something to
guarantee 2)? I don't know pmem well, just personal thought.
