Yeah, it's past my "last date for this merge cycle" which was
-rc6. I expected stuff might slip a little - as it has with the LARP
code - but I don't have the time and bandwidth to start working
on merging another feature from scratch before the merge window
comes around.

Getting the dax+reflink stuff in this cycle was always an optimistic
stretch, but I wanted to try so that there was no doubt it would be
ready for merge in the next cycle...

It'll need to be a stable branch somewhere, but I don't think it
really matters where al long as it's merged into the xfs for-next
tree so it gets filesystem test coverage...

Cheers,

Dave.
