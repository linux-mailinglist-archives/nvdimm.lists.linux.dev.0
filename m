Hi Dan,

I'm low on time unfortunately and will be OoO for next week,
But whilst fixing a bug in QEMU, I set up a test to exercise
the high port target register on the hb with

CFMWS interleave ways = 1
hb with 8 rp with a type3 device connected to each.

The resulting interleave granularity isn't what I'd expect to see.
Setting region interleave to 1k (which happens to match the CFMWS)
I'm getting 1k for the CFMWS, 2k for the hb and 256 bytes for the type3
devices.  Which is crazy...  Now there may be another bug lurking
in QEMU so this might not be a kernel issue at all.

For this special case we should be ignoring the CFMWS IG
as it's irrelevant if we aren't interleaving at that level.
We also know we don't have any address bits used for interleave
decoding until the HB.

Thanks,

Jonathan
