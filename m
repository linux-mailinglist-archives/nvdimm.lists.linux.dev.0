If you are asking about adopting something like the failmalloc
should_fail() strategy in qemu, you'd essentially open code a call to
a should_fail() and in it pass the arguments you want from your
own call down. If you want to ignore size you can just pass 0
for instance.

If you mean in Linux, you would open code a should_fail()
specific to the area as in this commit old commit example, and
adding a respective kconfig entry for it:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a8b6502fb669c3a0638a08955442814cedc86b1

Eech of these knobs then get its own probability, times, and space
debugfs entries which let the routine should_fail() fail when the
parameters set meet the criteria set by debugfs.

There are ways to make this much more scalable though, but I had not
seen many efforts to do so. I did start such an approach using debugfs
specific to *one* kconfig entry, for instance see this block layer proposed
change, which would in turn enable tons of different ways to enable failing
if CONFIG_FAIL_ADD_DISK would be used:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20210512064629.13899-9-mcgrof@kernel.org/

However, at the recent discussion at LSFMM for this we decided instead
to just sprinkle ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() after each routine. Otherwise
you are open coding tons of new "should_fail()" calls in your runtime
path and that can make it hard to review patches and is just a lot of
noise in code.

But with CONFIG_FAIL_FUNCTION this means you don't have to open code
should_fail() calls, but instead for each routine you want to add a failure
injection support you'd just use ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() per call.

Read Documentation/fault-injection/fault-injection.rst on
fail_function/injectable and fail_function/<function-name>/retval,
so we could do for instance, to avoid a namespace clash I just
added the cxl_ prefix:

This lets's us then modprobe the cxl modules and then:

root@kdevops-dev ~ # grep ^cxl /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/injectable 
cxl_init_hdm_decoder [cxl_core] ERRNO

echo cxl_init_hdm_decoder > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/cxl_init_hdm_decoder/
printf %#x -6 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/cxl_init_hdm_decoder/retval

Now this routine will return -ENXIO (-6) when called but I think
you still need to set the probability for this to not be 0:

cat /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/probability 
0

In the world where ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() is not used we'd get one of
each of the probability, space and times for each new failure injection
function.

I think that if you want to make use of variable failures depending on
input data you might as well open code your own should_fail() calls
as I did in the above referenced block layer patches for add_disk with
your own kconfig entry.

ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() seems to be useful if you are OK to do simple
failures based on a return code and probably a probablity / times
values (times means that if you say 2 it will fail ever 2 calls).

There are odd uses of ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() but I can't say I'm a fan
of: drivers/platform/surface/aggregator/ssh_packet_layer.c

> For all fs, I'm not sure how we'd get that value?

You'd echo the return value you want to fake a failure for into the
debugfs retval. If you open code your own should_fail() you can use
size, space, probability in whatever you see fit.

I'd imagine as in any subsystem finding the few key areas you *do* want
test coverage for failure injection will be a nice fun next step. It is
understandable if init_hdm_decoder() is not it.
